== Overview

In this assignment, you will need to make a presentation of your work. The
length of the presentation will be based on how many students are enrolled in
the class and will be announced well before the due date. A good talk will
include a clear statement of the problem you are studying, a discussion of how
you went about investigating the problem and the results.

Teams will be randomly ordered on presentation day(s) so if you are late to
class you could miss your time slot. Students can not request to go first or
last. While minor technical difficulties are expected and will not impact your
grade, it is expected that students make their presentation as robust as
possible, a minor glitch should not tank your entire presentation. Here are some
tips to ensure you have a smooth experience:

== Requirements

. Make sure your presentation is available in multiple formats. For
example you should upload your presentation to your google drive
account and copy it to a flash drive.
. Make sure you have all the correct dongles to connect to the
projector. If you have a Mac with only thunderbolt connectors
you need to make sure you bring what is necessary to hook into the
projectors. If you show up to class on presentation day and you
can't connect to the projectors because you don't have the correct
dongles your grade may be impacted!
. Make sure your laptop is charged! Make sure you have your charger
with you. If you are running windows make sure you have updates
paused and reboot your computer to make sure everything is working.
. Test your setup in the classroom before the presentation day to
make sure everything works. Your instructor can arrange time for
you to test your setup in the classroom, it is strongly encouraged
that teams take advantage of this!
. The only thing that should stop you from presenting is a power
outage, so plan accordingly!
. If the presentations are done remotely using zoom make sure that you
have a reliable internet connection and a quiet place to present.
. All students must have their cameras on if the presentations are over zoom.
If students don't have a camera they must notify the instructor *before*
presentations are due!

*NOTE:* When presentations are done over zoom students will not be penalized for tech issues
that are outside of their control such as bandwidth problems, dropped connections, etc. This
rubric was derived from an example at
