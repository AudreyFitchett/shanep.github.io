= Process API
include::../../includes/attributes-settings.adoc[]

== Key Process API

* fork()
* wait()
* exec()
* kill()
* pipe()

== Fork üç¥

* creates a child process that is a clone of the parent
* The child process differs from the parent process only in its process id and its parent process id
* The fork() is called once but it returns twice!

=== Process Hierarchy

=== Exercise

On success, the PID of the child process is returned in the parent, and 0 is
returned in the child.  On failure, -1 is returned in the parent, no child
process is created, and errno is set to indicate the error.

/* process A */
 /* ... */
 if ( fork () == 0) {
    if ( fork () == 0) {
        if ( fork () == 0) {
            if ( fork () == 0) {
                /* do something */
            }
        }
    }

How many new processes are created by the code snippet?

== Waitüöè

Sometimes, as it turns out, it is quite useful for a parent to wait for a child
process to finish what it has been doing. This task is accomplished with the
wait() system call (or its more complete sibling waitpid()

== Exec

A final and important piece of the process creation API is the exec() system
call. This system call is useful when you want to run a program that is
different from the calling program

== Linux vs Windows

|===
|Linux | Win32
|fork(), exec() | CreateProcess() (fork exec combined)
| exit() | ExitProcess()
| wait(), waitpid() | WaitForSingleObject(), WaitForMultipleObjects()
| kill() | TerminateProcess()

== Signals

Linux/Unix signals are a type of event. Signals are asynchronous in nature and
are used to inform processes of certain events happening (man 7 signal).

=== Examples

* SIGINT
* SIGCONT
* SIGKILL
