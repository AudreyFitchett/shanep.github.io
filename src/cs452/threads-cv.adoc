= Condition Variables ðŸš€
include::../../includes/attributes-settings.adoc[]


== Why?

* There are many cases where a thread wishes to check whether a condition is
true before continuing its execution
* A naive approach could just constantly check a global (spin)
** hugely inefficient as this wastes CPU time

== Definition and Routines

* To wait for a condition to become true, a thread can make use of what is known
as a condition variable.

* A condition variable is an explicit queue that threads can put themselves on
when some state of execution (i.e., some condition) is not as desired (by
waiting on the condition)

=== Simple Example

[,c]
----
1 int done = 0;
2 pthread_mutex_t m = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
3 pthread_cond_t c = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;
4
5 void thr_exit() {
6   Pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
7   done = 1;
8   Pthread_cond_signal(&c);
9   Pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
10 }
11
12 void *child(void *arg) {
13  printf("child\n");
14  thr_exit();
15  return NULL;
16 }
17
18 void thr_join() {
19  Pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
20  while (done == 0)
21  Pthread_cond_wait(&c, &m);
22  Pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
23 }

== Semantics

* When checking your condition use a while loop (Mesa Semantics)
* Hoare semantics, is harder to build but provides a stronger guarantee
that the woken thread will run immediately upon being woken
* Virtually every system ever built employs Mesa semantics.

== Spurious Wakeups

In some thread packages, due to details of the implementation, it is possible
that two threads get woken up though just a single signal has taken place.
Spurious wakeups are further reason to re-check the condition a thread is
waiting on.
