== Locks: The Basic Idea

[,c]
----
balance = balance + 1;

1 lock_t mutex; // some globally-allocated lock â€™mutexâ€™
2 ...
3 lock(&mutex);
4 balance = balance + 1;
5 unlock(&mutex);
----

==  Pthread Locks

The name that the POSIX library uses for a lock is a mutex, as it is used
to provide mutual exclusion between threads, i.e., if one thread is in the
critical section, it excludes the others from entering until it has completed
the section.

=== Example

[,c]
----
1 pthread_mutex_t lock = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
2
3 Pthread_mutex_lock(&lock); // wrapper; exits on failure
4 balance = balance + 1;
5 Pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);

==  Building A Lock

* To build a working lock, we will need some help from our old friend, the hardware
* Must provide mutual exclusion
* Must be fair (thread starvation)
* Must be performant (can't add too much overhead)

=== Hardware support

Each platform architecture may provide different support to help build locks.
The core idea in all these instructions is they are atomic. Meaning that they
are guaranteed to complete once started.

* Interrupts
* test-and-set
* compare-and-swap (SPARC)
* compare-and-exchange (x86)
* load-linked and store-conditional (MIPS)
* Fetch-and-add

== Examples

Lets look at just a few examples of building a lock! ðŸ”’

== Controlling Interrupts

[,c]
----
1 void lock() {
2       DisableInterrupts();
3 }
4 void unlock() {
5       EnableInterrupts();
6 }
----

=== Evaluating

* The main positive of this approach is its simplicity
* The negatives, unfortunately, are many
** Any calling thread to perform a privileged operation
** Thread can die before unlocking making the system unusable.
* Does not work on multiprocessors

== Test-And-Set

We define what the test-and-set instruction does via the following C code
snippet.

[,c]
----
1 int TestAndSet(int *old_ptr, int new) {
2       int old = *old_ptr; // fetch old value at old_ptr
3       *old_ptr = new; // store new into old_ptr
4       return old; // return the old value
5 }
----

WARNING: The example above is just for illustration purposes. A real TestAndSet
function would need to use inline ASM to be correct. See the code examples!

=== Test-And-Set details

* Hardware instruction to test and set a variable atomicity
* It returns the old value pointed to by the old_ptr, and simultaneously updates
said value to new
* Other instructions are compare_and_swap or compare-and-exchange
* Typically implemented in assembly language.

== Dekker's and Peterson's Algorithms

Dekker's algorithm and Peterson's algorithm attempted to solve the mutual
exclusion algorithm with only load and store instructions. These algorithms
don't work on modern hardware (due to relaxed memory consistency models).

== Spin Locks

* It is the simplest type of lock to build, and simply spins,
using CPU cycles, until the lock becomes available.
* To work correctly on a single processor, it requires a preemptive scheduler
(i.e., one that will interrupt a thread via a timer, in order to run a different
thread, from time to time).

=== Evaluating

* What are some advantages to spin locks?
* What are some disadvantages?
