== Threads!

image::images/threads-intro.jpg[Threading]

== What is a Thread

Instead of our classic view of a single point of execution within a program
(i.e., a single PC where instructions are being fetched from and executed), a
multi-threaded program has more than one point of execution (i.e., multiple PCs,
each of which is being fetched and executed from).

=== More details

Perhaps another way to think of this is that each thread is very much like a
separate process, except for one difference: they share the same address space
and thus can access the same data.

== Important Terms

* A **critical section** is a piece of code that accesses a shared resource, usually
a variable or data structure.
* A **race condition** arises if multiple threads of execution enter the critical
section at roughly the same time
* An **indeterminate program** consists of one or more race conditions; the output
of the program varies from run to run, depending on which threads ran when.
* **mutual exclusion** guarantees that only a single thread ever enters a
critical section, thus avoiding races, and resulting in deterministic program
outputs.

== Code Example

We assume that the process never terminates in the pre-protocol, critical
section, and post-protocol areas. A process can terminate abnormally in the
remainder section. If a process dies in the remainder section, it should not
affect other processes.

[,c]
----
for(;;){
        /*pre-protocol*/
        /*critical section*/
        /*post-protocol*/
        /*remainder*/
}
----

== Context Switch

* Threads will context switch just like processes
* Instead of a Process control block (PCB) we have a thread control block (TCB)
* In a TCB the address space remains the same!

== Memory Layout

== Why Use Threads?

* First reason: Parallelism üöôüöôüöô
* The second reason: to avoid blocking program progress due to slow I/O
** Opening and reading 10 files all at once!

=== Why not just processes?

* Of course, in either of the cases mentioned above, you could use multiple
processes instead of threads.
* Threads share an address space and thus make it easy to share data, and hence
are a natural choice when constructing these types of programs
* Processes are a more sound choice for logically separate tasks where little
sharing of data structures in memory is needed.

== Example

[,c]
----
1 #include <stdio.h>
2 #include <assert.h>
3 #include <pthread.h>
4 #include "common.h"
5 #include "common_threads.h"
6
7 void *mythread(void *arg) {
8       printf("%s\n", (char *) arg);
9       return NULL;
10 }
11
12 int
13 main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
14      pthread_t p1, p2;
15      int rc;
16      printf("main: begin\n");
17      Pthread_create(&p1, NULL, mythread, "A");
18      Pthread_create(&p2, NULL, mythread, "B");
19      // join waits for the threads to finish
20      Pthread_join(p1, NULL);
21      Pthread_join(p2, NULL);
22      printf("main: end\n");
23      return 0;
24 }

== Instruction Interleaving

We don't control the scheduler! ‚ö†Ô∏è

[,c]
----
counter = counter + 1;

// Assembly
mov 0x8049a1c, %eax
add $0x1, %eax
mov %eax, 0x8049a1c
----

=== Example

== Atomicity

One way to solve this problem would be to have more powerful instructions that,
in a single step, did exactly whatever we needed done and thus removed the
possibility of an untimely interrupt.

[,c]
----
//pretend atomic add instruction!
memory-add 0x8049a1c, $0x1

//Performs all three instructions without interruption!
mov 0x8049a1c, %eax
add $0x1, %eax
mov %eax, 0x8049a1c
----

== Synchronization Primitives

* Need to build primitives that allow us to do atomic operations
** Locks üîí
* Need to build primitives that allow us to wait for action to be complete
** Condition Variables
* Need to build more powerful primitives
** Semaphores

== Why in OS Class?

Why are we studying this in OS class? ‚ÄúHistory‚Äù is the one-word answer; the OS
was the first concurrent program, and many techniques were created for use
within the OS. Later, with multi-threaded processes, application programmers
also had to consider such things.
