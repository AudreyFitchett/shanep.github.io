== Overview

In this project you will implement a FIFO queue as a monitor that can be used to
solve the bounded buffer problem. Your queue will have a fixed capacity and will
block calling threads when it is full or empty. Bounded buffers are extremely
common in Operating Systems. When you write code in Java, Python, C#, etc. it
may seem like you have infinite memory. However, infinite memory is just an
abstraction that the OS provides, in reality you are limited by the physical
hardware the OS is running on. This data structure could be used to build higher
level abstractions like a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool[thread pool].

== Learning Outcomes

* 1.5	 Use simple shell scripts and system tools to analyze process behavior
* 3.3	 Identify the sources of deadlocks, race conditions, memory stomps and data loss
* 3.4	 Apply concurrent programming techniques such as threads, event loops, and inter-process communication
