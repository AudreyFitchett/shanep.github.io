== Why This Class?

This class is important because your code will be running on some sort of
computing device and you will need to know how an operating system works in
order to write good code and solve hard problems.

In this course we will explore what an operating system is and its purpose. In
the simplest terms an operating system is just a program that runs other
programs. The operating system provides an abstraction that allows programmers
to think in a higher level and not have to worry (as much) about how things
actually get done. Instead of issuing commands to the hard disk to position the
read head you can just call
https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fopen/[fopen] and start reading
bytes.

== Virtualization

Everything you have been taught is a lie!

=== Virtualizing the CPU

An operating system gives the illusion that you can run multiple processes at
once. In reality you can only run one process (per core) at a time. The
operating system and cpu switch so fast that we perceive things happening all at
once. This is similar to how a movie is really just a bunch of pictures shown in
rapid succession, our brains perceive motion when there is none!

=== Virtualizing Memory

Most modern machines use a flat memory model, which means the machine represents
memory as a big array. The operating system with assistance from hardware such
as a memory management unit (MMU) and the translation lookaside buffer (TLB)
creates a virtual memory address space to give the illusion that each process
has access to 100% of the machine memory.

The operating system is also responsible for protecting processes from each
other. You don't want your errant program that has a segfault to take down your
entire machine!

== Concurrency

Concurrency is typically introduced in an Operating System class in a
traditional CS curriculum because the operating system is responsible for
scheduling processes to run on the CPU. Languages like golang extend the
threading concept by multiplexing multiple user space threads onto one (or more)
operating system threads.

Concurrency adds a whole bunch of new problems that you have to deal with when
writing high performance programs. We will look at how to use mutexes,
semaphores, and pthreads and the common problems that result such as race
conditions and deadlocks.

== Persistence

At some point you are going to need to save data. An operating system provides
abstractions that allow you to persist data to non-volatile storage without
having to worry about the specific medium that a machine may have. For example,
saving data to a hard disk drive (hdd) is the exact same operation as saving to
a solid state drive (ssd). Under the hood however the hardware is very different
and requires different drivers. The operating system allows you to treat to very
different pieces of hardware in exactly the same way!

== Beyond Linux, MacOS, Linux

A small collection of research, hobby, and production operating systems. Some of
these are in active development some have been abandoned years ago.
