== Paging

Instead of splitting up a process's address space into some number of
variable-sized logical segments (e.g., code, heap, stack), we divide it into
fixed-sized units, each of which we call a page.

* page frames - physical memory as an array of fixed-sized slots

== Page Table

To record where each virtual page of the address space is placed in physical
memory, the operating system usually keeps a per-process data structure known as
a page table.
