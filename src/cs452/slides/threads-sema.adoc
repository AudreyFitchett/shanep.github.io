== Semaphores: A Definition

A semaphore is an object with an integer value that we can manipulate
with two routines; in the POSIX standard, these routines are sem_wait()
and sem_post()

=== Some code

[,c]
----
1 int sem_wait(sem_t *s) {
2 decrement the value of semaphore s by one
3 wait if value of semaphore s is negative
4 }
5
6 int sem_post(sem_t *s) {
7 increment the value of semaphore s by one
8 if there are one or more threads waiting, wake one
9 }
----

== Binary Semaphores (Locks)

Because locks only have two states (held and not held), we sometimes call a
semaphore used as a lock a binary semaphore.

== Semaphores For Ordering

* Semaphores are also useful to order events in a concurrent program.
* One thread waits for something to happen (blocks on a semaphore)
* Another thread making that something happen and then signaling that it has happened

== Reader-Writer Locks

* Multiple concurrent readers at a time
* Only one writer at a time

== Thread Throttling

Use a semaphore to limit the number of threads concurrently executing the piece
of code in question

== Example Implementation

[,c]
----
1 typedef struct __Zem_t {
2   int value;
3   pthread_cond_t cond;
4   pthread_mutex_t lock;
5 } Zem_t;
6
7 // only one thread can call this
8 void Zem_init(Zem_t *s, int value) {
9   s->value = value;
10  Cond_init(&s->cond);
11  Mutex_init(&s->lock);
12 }
13
14 void Zem_wait(Zem_t *s) {
15  Mutex_lock(&s->lock);
16  while (s->value <= 0)
17      Cond_wait(&s->cond, &s->lock);
18  s->value--;
19  Mutex_unlock(&s->lock);
20 }
21
22 void Zem_post(Zem_t *s) {
23  Mutex_lock(&s->lock);
24  s->value++;
25  Cond_signal(&s->cond);
26  Mutex_unlock(&s->lock);
27 }
----

== Summary

Semaphores are a powerful and flexible primitive for writing concurrent
programs. Some programmers use them exclusively, shunning locks and condition
variables, due to their simplicity and utility.
