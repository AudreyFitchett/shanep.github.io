== Files And Directories

* File - A file is simply a linear array of bytes, each of which you can read or
write

* Directory - A directory, like a file, also has a low-level name (i.e., an
inode number), but its contents are quite specific: it contains a list of
(user-readable name, low-level name) pairs

== Interface

Let's now discuss the file system interface in more detail. We'll start
with the basics of creating, accessing, and deleting files

=== Creating Files

[,c]
----
int fd = open("foo", O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC,
    S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR);
----

One important aspect of open() is what it returns: a file descriptor. A file
descriptor is just an integer, private per process, and is used in UNIX systems
to access files; thus, once a file is opened, you use the file descriptor to
read or write the file, assuming you have permission to do so.

=== Reading And Writing Files

[,bash]
----
$ strace cat foo
...
open("foo", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = 3
read(3, "hello\n", 4096) = 6
write(1, "hello\n", 6) = 6
hello
read(3, "", 4096) = 0
close(3) = 0
----

== Process Sharing

== Buffering

Most times when a program calls write(), it is just telling the file system:
please write this data to persistent storage, at some point in the future.

When a process calls fsync() for a particular file descriptor, the file system
responds by forcing all dirty (i.e., not yet written) data to disk, for the file
referred to by the specified file descriptor.

==  Getting Information About Files

Beyond file access, we expect the file system to keep a fair amount of
information about each file it is storing. We generally call such data about
files metadata. To see the metadata for a certain file, we can use the stat() or
fstat() system calls.

=== Example

[,c]
----
struct stat {
    dev_t st_dev; // ID of device containing file
    ino_t st_ino; // inode number
    mode_t st_mode; // protection
    nlink_t st_nlink; // number of hard links
    uid_t st_uid; // user ID of owner
    gid_t st_gid; // group ID of owner
    dev_t st_rdev; // device ID (if special file)
    off_t st_size; // total size, in bytes
    blksize_t st_blksize; // blocksize for filesystem I/O
    blkcnt_t st_blocks; // number of blocks allocated
    time_t st_atime; // time of last access
    time_t st_mtime; // time of last modification
    time_t st_ctime; // time of last status change
};
----

== Removing Files

[,bash]
----
$ strace rm foo
...
unlink("foo") = 0
...
----

* Removing a file doesn't wipe it from the disk! The file is still there just
not directly accessible! Deleted files can still be recovered (for a while).

==  Symbolic Links

* There is one other type of link that is really useful, and it is called a
symbolic link or sometimes a soft link.

* This allows you to create a link or pointer to a file

== Permission Bits

[,bash]
----
$ ls -l foo.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 remzi wheel 0 Aug 24 16:29 foo.txt
----

* The first character here just shows the type of the file: - for a regular file
* The permissions consist of three groupings: what the owner of the file can do
to it, what someone in a group can do to the file, and finally, what anyone
(sometimes referred to as other) can do.


=== Mounting file systems

Linux has a single root for its directory while windows has a multi-root
approach.

[,bash]
----
$ mount -t ext3 /dev/sda1 /home/users
----

== Demo

* Symbolic links
* permissions (chmod, chown)
* Permission bits
