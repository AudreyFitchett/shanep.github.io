== THE CRUX

The OS must virtualize the CPU in an efficient manner while retaining control
over the system. To do so, both hardware and operating-system support will be
required. The OS will often use a judicious bit of hardware support in order to
accomplish its work effectively.

== Limited Direct Execution

* The “direct execution” part of the idea is simple: just run the program
directly on the CPU.
* The Limited part of the idea means the process only has a subset of the CPU
instructions available to use when running

=== Details

Direct execution means the program will run fast (bare metal) compare this to
Java or C# which run in a Virtual Machine.

== Problem #1 Restricted Operations

* User Mode - code that runs in user mode is restricted in what it can do.
* Kernel Mode - In this mode, code that runs can do what it likes, including
privileged operations such as issuing I/O requests and executing all types of
restricted instructions.

=== How?

Special instructions to trap into the kernel and return-from-trap back to
user-mode programs are also provided, as well as instructions that allow
the OS to tell the hardware where the trap table resides in memory.

=== Trap Table

* The kernel sets up a trap table at boot time
* To specify the exact system call, a system-call number is usually assigned to each system call.
* What horrible things could you do to a system if you could install your own trap table? Could you take over the machine?

== Problem #2  Switching Between Processes

* If a process is running on the CPU, this by definition means the OS is not running
* How can the operating system regain control of the CPU so that it can switch between processes?

=== A Cooperative Approach

Cooperative Approach - the OS trusts the processes of the system to behave reasonably

=== A Non-Cooperative Approach

image::images/take-control.jpeg[Take control]

* The OS Takes Control - Needs hardware support
* Timer interrupt!

== Saving and Restoring Context

* The OS scheduler decides what to run next
* A Context switch is what happens when on process is moved off the processor
and another is moved on

== Concurrency?

* Now we have to worry about what happens when we get interrupted right in the
middle of doing something important
* Not to worry we will go over that in a future chapter!

== Questions?
