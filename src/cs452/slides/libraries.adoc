== What are Libraries

* A dynamic-link library (DLL or .so) is a module that contains functions and data
* Applications (processes) can use the functions and data in the code
* This is the most common way code is distributed. 
* Up until this point you have only ever distributed code in an executable (exe)


== Dynamic Libraries

* During compile time the linker stubs out calls to the .dll or .so
* The actual implementation is not added into the image that is saved to disk
* The library is mapped into your applications address space at run time

=== Load-time dynamic linking

Your code makes explicit calls to exported DLL functions as if they were local functions.

=== Run-time dynamic linking

Functions are loaded with system calls such as LoadLibrary or LoadLibraryEx (WIN32)

== Advantages of Dynamic Linking

* Multiple processes that load the same DLL at the same base address will share a single copy of the DLL
* When you update a DLL the applications that use them do not need to be recompiled
* Programs written in different programming languages can call the same DLL functions

=== Disadvantages of Dynamic Linking

== Static Libraries

* Similar to dynamic libraries
* Code is added into your application at compile time instead of runtime. The library becomes part of the image saved on disk
* Your application will not have any dependencies that need to be resolved at runtime

=== Advantages of Static Linking

* All your code is contained in one file (your exe or lib)
* Easier to ship to a customer
* Could be more secure because you know exactly what you are loading
* Eliminates any issues with missing libraries on the host system

=== Disadvantages of Static Linking

* Your program is bigger and takes longer  to load into memory
* If there is a security flaw in your linked code you will still be using the old version
* If library code get faster or adds support for new hardware you are stuck on the old version

== Dependency Types

=== Implicit Dependency

Module A is implicitly linked with Module B at compile/link time

=== Explicit Dependency

Module A is not linked with Module B at compile/link time. At runtime, Module A
dynamically loads Module B via a LoadLibrary type function

=== Forward Dependency

Module A is linked with a LIB file for Module B at compile/link time, and Module
A's source code actually calls one or more functions in Module B. One of the
functions called in Module B is actually a forwarded function call to Module C
