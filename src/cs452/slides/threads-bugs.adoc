== Non-Deadlock Bugs

Non-deadlock bugs make up a majority of concurrency bugs, according to Lu's
study. But what types of bugs are these? How do they arise? How can we fix them?

=== Atomicity-Violation Bugs

AKA: Memory Stops

[,c]
----
Thread 1::
if (thd->proc_info) {
    fputs(thd->proc_info, ...);
}

Thread 2::
thd->proc_info = NULL;
----

* How to fix this?

=== Order-Violation Bugs

AKA: Race Conditions

[,c]
----
Thread 1::
void init() {
    mThread = PR_CreateThread(mMain, ...);
}

Thread 2::
void mMain(...) {
    mState = mThread->State;
}

== Deadlock

=== Example

[,c]
----
Thread 1: Thread 2:
pthread_mutex_lock(L1); pthread_mutex_lock(L2);
pthread_mutex_lock(L2); pthread_mutex_lock(L1);
----

=== Conditions for Deadlock

* Mutual exclusion: Threads claim exclusive control of resources that
they require (e.g., a thread grabs a lock).
* Hold-and-wait: Threads hold resources allocated to them (e.g., locks
that they have already acquired) while waiting for additional resources (e.g., locks that they wish to acquire).
* No preemption: Resources (e.g., locks) cannot be forcibly removed
from threads that are holding them.
* Circular wait: There exists a circular chain of threads such that each
thread holds one or more resources (e.g., locks) that are being requested by the next thread in the chain.

=== Prevention

* Circular Wait - total ordering or partial ordering
* Hold-and-wait - global lock
* try-lock
* lock free data structures (HARD!)
