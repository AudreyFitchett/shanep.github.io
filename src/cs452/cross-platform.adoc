== VSCode Notes

The VSCode CMake extension (2023-10-17) does not support all the features of
cmake presets that this project uses so you will need to add the following to
your settings.json file so that the extension does not complain about the
new features we are using.`"cmake.allowUnsupportedPresetsVersions": true`
