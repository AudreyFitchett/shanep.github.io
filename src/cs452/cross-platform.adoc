Notes for developing cross platform applications with C/C++ and cmake using the
https://github.com/shanep/cpp-project-template[cpp-project-template]. While the
project template is configured to download and install some of the required
dependencies each operating system still needs to have some tools installed to
proceed. The following sections will help you install the required dependencies
for each operating system.

NOTE: Every Semester new issues pop up because of software upgrades and other
changes that are outside of your instructors control so if you encounter any
errors please attend office hours so we can work through the issues and update
this document ðŸ˜ƒ.

== VSCode Notes

The VSCode CMake extension (2023-10-17) does not support all the features of
cmake presets that this project uses so you will need to add the following to
your settings.json file so that the extension does not complain about the
new features we are using.`"cmake.allowUnsupportedPresetsVersions": true`.
