== Overview

This assignment is intended to serve as an introduction to the build tools that
you will be using this semester.  I have created a
https://github.com/shanep/cpp-project-template[template] that will work for all
the projects. This is the only **officially** supported template. If you feel
ambitions you can create your own template using what ever  programming language
and set of tools that you like. However, be aware that some assignments require
you to deal with raw (untyped) memory which languages like python can't do
without diving down into C.

If you want to use a language like https://www.rust-lang.org/[Rust] you must
create your own starter code template that works with the class grading
framework and have it approved by the instructor. Choosing an unsupported
language qualifies you for bonus points on the every project. So you will have
to decide if the risk is worth the reward üòÉ.

== ‚úÖ Instructor support systems

Your instructor and GA/TA will support the Kount Lab, Onyx and GitHub
codespaces. If you are working in the lab follow the instructions in the
https://github.com/shanep/cpp-project-template/blob/master/README-KOUNT-LAB.md[CS
Lab] document. Otherwise you can use
https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart[GitHub
Codespaces] to work on your projects.

=== VSCode Notes

The VSCode CMake extension (2023-10-17) does not support all the features of
cmake presets that this project uses so you will need to add the following to
your settings.json file so that the extension does not complain about the
new features we are using.`"cmake.allowUnsupportedPresetsVersions": true`.

== Cross Platform Development

While the https://github.com/shanep/cpp-project-template[project template] is
configured to download and install some of the required dependencies each
operating system still needs to have some tools installed to proceed. The
following sections will help you install the required dependencies for each
operating system. Every Semester new issues pop up because of software upgrades
and other changes that are outside of your instructors control so if you
encounter any errors please let your instructor know what you did to fix the
problem so this section can be updated for other students üòÉ.

WARNING: The systems listed below have been tested by your instructor to work at one
point in time. However, due to the high number of permutations that students
personal systems can come in all systems listed below are **not supported**. If
you can not get your personal system to work then you will need to work in
either codespaces or in the CS Lab.
