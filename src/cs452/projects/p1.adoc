== Overview

This assignment is intended to serve as a warm up assignment. In this class you
can choose to implement your assignments using any programming language that has
a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface[FFI] for C. The only
**officially** supported languages are C/C+\+, and Rust because your instructor
doesn't have the bandwidth to support 40+ students all using a different
language and different tool sets. All the code examples will be in C/C++ or Rust
and the text book is in C. So if you choose to use Java or Python you are 100%
on your own regarding help with bugs and errors and will have to translate the
example code from your instructor and the book into your language of choice.

In order to keep your sanity during the semester you are encouraged to choose
one language now and stick with it for the rest of the semester. This project is
intended to be light weight in order to give you some time to explore using a
programming language of your choice.

Below are some links to help you get started with each language:

* Java - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/intro.html[JNI]
* Python - https://python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extending/extending.html[extension
modules].
* Rust - https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/ffi.html[FFI]


WARNING: If you use a language other than the officially support languages you
are 100% on your own. However, choosing unsupported language qualifies you for
bonus points on the every project. So you will have to decide if the risk is
worth the reward ðŸ˜ƒ.

== Learning Outcomes

This project measures the following course learning outcomes:

* 4.1	 Produce code that is free of all memory leaks
* 4.2	 Produce code without any out of bounds read/write errors
* 5.1	 Use a cross platform build system (win, linux)
* 5.2	 Use a professional unit test framework  (win, linux)
* 5.3	 Use a professional version control system (git)

== Circular Linked List with Sentinel Node

It is sometimes helpful to draw out what your data structure will look like in
memory before you start coding anything up. Having a visual model to reference
can aid in both development and testing. The diagram below shows a list with 3
elements and a sentinel node. You can see that the next pointer in node **n3**
points back to the sentinel node and the prev pointer of  **n1**  points back to
the sentinel node. Each node has a data pointer that will hold a reference to
the data that is being stored in the list. Using a sentinel node allows us to
write slightly simpler algorithms when manipulating the list.

== Thinking in C

Java is an Object Oriented (OO) programming language while C is an imperative
language. The purpose of both is to break large computing tasks into smaller
ones. While pre-ANSI C (known as K&R C) had very strange function declarations,
functions in ANSI C (C89 and greater) have a similar look and feel to Java.

One of the biggest differences between functions in C and methods in Java is
Java groups your functions and data together into a class. So in java if you
want to create a new linked list and then add something to it you would create a
new list and then call the **add** method on that list:

```java
Mylist list = new Mylist();
list.add(new Object());
```

In C the code above would be written as follows:

```c
struct object *obj = create_object();
struct mylist *list = create_list();
list_add(list, obj);
```

So as you can see with the examples above any code that is written in Java using
objects can be translated to C!

== Starter Code

Each code block below is the starter code that you must use for this project.
The README.md file in your github project will contain instructions on where
to place the code blocks below.
