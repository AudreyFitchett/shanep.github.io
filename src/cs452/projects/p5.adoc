== Overview

In this project you will implement a FIFO queue as a monitor that can be used to
solve the bounded buffer problem. Your queue will have a fixed capacity and will
block calling threads when it is full or empty. Bounded buffers are extremely
common in Operating Systems. When you write code in Java, Python, C#, etc. it
may seem like you have infinite memory. However, infinite memory is just an
abstraction that the OS provides, in reality you are limited by the physical
hardware the OS is running on. This data structure could be used to build higher
level abstractions like a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool[thread pool].

== Learning Outcomes

* 1.5	 Use simple shell scripts and system tools to analyze process behavior
* 3.3	 Identify the sources of deadlocks, race conditions, memory stomps and data loss
* 3.4	 Apply concurrent programming techniques such as threads, event loops, and inter-process communication

== Task 1 - Bounded Queue

Your job is to implement a bounded queue that is defined in the starter code
`src/lab.h`. Your queue should be able to have multiple threads adding and
removing items without loss of data or crashing. The provided testing code is
setup to allow you to easily test your implementation. Unit testing
multi-threaded code is very difficult so in this project we will do our testing
in main.cpp. You can see all the options that the testing code gives you with
the **-h** flag.

[,bash]
----
$ ./myprogram -h
Usage: myprogram [-c num consumer] [-p num producer] [-i num items] [-s queue size]
----

== Task 3 - Stress test

The hard part about multi threaded programming is sometimes things work even
when the code is horribly broken! Running the code multiple times can sometimes
help to show these errors as shown below. Each example was from the exact same
code base and it produces different results depending on the timing (scheduling)
of the OS level threads.

You will need to implement a bash script named **stress.sh** that runs your
program with different numbers of producers, consumers, items, and sizes to make
sure you don't have any **race conditions** or deadlocks in your code. You can
use the very simple example below as a starting point you script will need to
be more robust that what is shown below.

[,bash]
----
$ while true
do
./myprogram -c 8 -p 5 -i 10000 -s 100 &>> /dev/null
done
----

=== Run #1 Error

In this example you can see that due to a race condition in the code somehow the
consumer was able to consume 11 items when the producer only produced 10!
Clearly there is something wrong! In industry this kind of error **only** shows
up on Friday at 4:45pm!

[,bash]
----

In this run you can see everything works great! This is how the code will run
Monday - Thursday, no issues here!! Both executions are from the exact same
executable.
