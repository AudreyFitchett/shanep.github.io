*** Start a new Codespace
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: start-a-new-codespace
:END:
We will use GitHub Codespaces to do most of our coding. Codespaces is
just VSCode in the cloud. This makes it really easy to setup a developer
environment and code from any computer that has a browser and internet
connection!

that is ready to use.
