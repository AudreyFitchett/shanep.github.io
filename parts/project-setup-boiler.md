## Task 1 - Setup

Follow the steps below to get your repository all setup and ready to use. The steps below show you
how to use and setup GitHub codespaces. You are not required to use codespaces, all the steps below can be
completed in the CS Lab or on your personal machine if you prefer.

### Fork the starter repository

1. Fork the starter repository into your personal GitHub account: **{{$frontmatter.repo}}**

### Start a new Codespace

We will use GitHub Codespaces to do most of our coding. Codespaces is just VSCode in the cloud. This
makes it really easy to setup a developer environment and code from any computer that has a browser
and internet connection!

1. If you are asked to install recommended extensions click "install". You may not be asked to
  install extensions if you are already syncing your account.

You now should have a new repository (forked from the starter template) that is ready to use.
