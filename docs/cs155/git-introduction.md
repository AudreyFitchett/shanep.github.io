# Git Introduction

Version control is everywhere. For example, Google Docs has a way to
[check or revert to earlier file
versions](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9308971?hl=en). Git,
however, is a LOT more powerful than what Google Docs provides. In
this module, we will learn the basics of how to use Git when developing
software.
