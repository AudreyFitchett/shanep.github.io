# Submit at Patch

In this project you will learn how to use git to create a patch that can be emailed to another
developer. This method of development is how git was originally designed to work and is still widely
used by massive projects like the [Linux
Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.15/process/submitting-patches.html).  You will be using
this method in your future classes so make sure and take the time to really understand this
process. It may take a few attempts to get everything correct but once you are able to wrap your
head around the process you will have unlocked a powerful software development skill!

## Task 1 - Setup Email

In order to use [git send-email](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-send-email) you will need to generate
an app password. Navigate to
[https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords](https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords)
and generate a new app password. Make sure and copy the password before you close the window because
you will not be able to see it again.

::: warning
Make sure you use your university supplied email when generating your password. Do not use your
personal Gmail account or you will not receive a grade on the assignment.
:::

## Task 2 - Setup SMTP

Open up a terminal (git-bash on windows) and configure git. You will need to change the info listed
below to match your own name, email and Password that you generated in the previous step.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@u.boisestate.edu"
git config --global sendemail.smtpserver smtp.gmail.com
git config --global sendemail.smtpuser "you@u.boisestate.edu"
git config --global sendemail.smtpPass "xxx xxx xxx xxx"
git config --global sendemail.smtpencryption ssl
git config --global sendemail.smtpserverport 465
```

## Task 3 - Clone Reno

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shanep/git-send-email
```

Create your first commit.

```bash
cd git-send-email
date >> the-date.txt
git add the-date.txt
git commit -m "Added a date file"
```

Create your second commit.

```bash
echo "My Name" > my-name.txt
git add my-name.txt
git commit -m "Added a file with my name in it"
```

Make sure everything looks good.

```bash
shane|(master>):git-send-email$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 2 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

:::info
You will not be pushing your changes back to GitHub, so do not do a `git push` :)
:::


## Task 4 - Create a patch file

We are now going to do what is called a [squash
merge](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/squash_and_merge.html) and then create
a patch file with all our changes in one commit.

- Checkout a new branch named submit from the `origin/master` branch.

```bash
git checkout origin/master -b submit
```

- Now we will do a squash merge onto our new submit branch.

```bash
git merge --squash master
```

- Now commit those new changes to your submit branch

```bash
git commit -m "Submit project 2"
```

This is what the whole sequence looks like.

```bash
shane|(submit=):git-send-email$ git merge --squash master
Updating 71c88c5..03028ce
Fast-forward
Squash commit -- not updating HEAD
 my-name.txt  | 1 +
 the-date.txt | 1 +
 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 my-name.txt
 create mode 100644 the-date.txt
shane|(submit +=):git-send-email$ git commit -m "Submit project 2"
[submit d9e1c85] Submit project 2
 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 my-name.txt
 create mode 100644 the-date.txt
shane|(submit>):git-send-email$ git status
On branch submit
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## Task 5 - Email Patch File

Finally we can create our patch to email out!

```bash
git send-email --to cs155-project-2-group@boisestate.edu HEAD^
```

Here is what the results should look like:

```bash
shane|(submit>):git-send-email$ git send-email --to cs155-project-2-group@boisestate.edu HEAD^
/var/folders/2f/gc7yl7651pj9l8k_tgwgd9c40000gn/T/NWEw4f1sIj/0001-Submit-project-2.patch
(mbox) Adding cc: Shane Panter <shanepanter@boisestate.edu> from line 'From: Shane Panter <shanepanter@boisestate.edu>'

From: Shane Panter <shanepanter@boisestate.edu>
To: cs155-project-2-group@boisestate.edu
Cc: Shane Panter <shanepanter@boisestate.edu>
Subject: [PATCH] Submit project 2
Date: Thu,  7 Dec 2023 20:31:55 -0700
Message-Id: <20231208033155.83099-1-shanepanter@boisestate.edu>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.39.3 (Apple Git-145)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

    The Cc list above has been expanded by additional
    addresses found in the patch commit message. By default
    send-email prompts before sending whenever this occurs.
    This behavior is controlled by the sendemail.confirm
    configuration setting.

    For additional information, run 'git send-email --help'.
    To retain the current behavior, but squelch this message,
    run 'git config --global sendemail.confirm auto'.

Send this email? ([y]es|[n]o|[e]dit|[q]uit|[a]ll): y
OK. Log says:
Server: smtp.gmail.com
MAIL FROM:<shanepanter@boisestate.edu>
RCPT TO:<cs155-project-2-group@boisestate.edu>

```

You should now be able to check your email and see your patch because `git send-email` automatically
adds the author to the CC list.

## Task 6 - Test your patch

You can now get your patch from GMail and test it to make sure that everything works and your patch
was correct.

- Checkout a new branch named `test-patch` from the origin/master branch

```bash
shane|(submit>):git-send-email$ git checkout origin/master -b test-patch
branch 'test-patch' set up to track 'origin/master'.
Switched to a new branch 'test-patch'
shane|(test-patch=):git-send-email$
```

- Get the patch file from GMail

![download gmail](images/gmail-original-email.png)


- Copy the email to your clip board and then create a file in the repository named my-patch.txt and paste the contents
  into that file.

![copy to clipboard](images/gmail-copy-email.png)

- Now apply that patch to your new `test-patch` branch

```bash
git am my-patch.txt
```

- This is an example of the complete process.

```bash
shane|(test-patch=):git-send-email$ ls
LICENSE      README.md    my-patch.txt
shane|(test-patch %=):git-send-email$ git am my-patch.txt
Applying: Submit project 2
shane|(test-patch %>):git-send-email$ git log
commit 7c547614e032064d2d0e8f0dbc0e8e8f22bb58f6 (HEAD -> test-patch)
Author: Shane Panter <shanepanter@boisestate.edu>
Date:   Thu Dec 7 20:31:55 2023 -0700

    Submit project 2

commit 71c88c58735532d679d7d51598b2b46b33d6c7e3 (origin/master, origin/HEAD)
Author: Shane K. Panter <shane@foundationcode.com>
Date:   Sun Dec 3 09:39:46 2023 -0700

    Initial commit
shane|(test-patch %>):git-send-email$ ls
LICENSE      README.md    my-name.txt  my-patch.txt the-date.txt
shane|(test-patch %>):git-send-email$ rm my-patch.txt
shane|(test-patch>):git-send-email$

```

Assuming all went well you are now complete! You have create a patch file from a squash merge and
then emailed and also tested the resulting email! You are well on your way to becoming an advanced
git user!

## Grading

There is nothing to submit on canvas for this assignment. Your email was your submission :)
