# Feature Development

You will be given in class time to meet with your team and instructor to collaborate
and work on your project features. In industry a typical software company will
have what is called a daily standup. We can't do a daily standup in
this class so we will be doing a weekly standup meeting using zoom.

## Class Time

Teams need to use class time to define and test the interfaces between each team members
respective module. Depending on the type of project you are doing this could consist of
(but not limited to) a Java interface file, a database schema or a REST interface.
