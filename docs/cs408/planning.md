# Planning

![Planning Lab](images/planning.gif)

In all the previous labs you have been preparing for this moment! You
are to take everything you learned about build systems, unit/system
testing,  and continuous integration, and meld it all
together into a complete project! Now you can work on adding features to your
project over the next few weeks of development.

You will need to do your planning as a team to ensure each component can interface properly.
Each member of the team will need to write a user story like you did in CS471
and write enough tasks to clearly detail what you will be working on over the next few weeks.

[Here](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories)
is a great refresher on how to write good user stories. Working on
your planning should be done as a team, review each others document to
ensure everyone is marching in the same direction.

Every team member will need to create a planning document using the
template provided in your repository located in the
[planning folder](https://github.com/shanep/capstone-starter/tree/master/planning).

## Calculating Workload

Estimating software development time is not an exact science. You learned several different methods
in CS471 such as planning poker which you can leverage to help with your estimates. Calculating
development time is even harder for students who have not had any internships or other industry
experience to help guide them. Classes such as CS221 or CS321 use projects that are well known
and completely planned before the student even starts. It is not reasonable to expect perfect
estimates however, it is reasonable to expect students to try and get as close as possible.

When calculating the amount of time that you should be working on each task we will use
policy [#4080](https://www.boisestate.edu/policy/academic-affairs-faculty-administration/policy-title-credit-hours/)
as a guide. The University has calculated the number of hours that a student must work per week at
roughly 3 hours per credit. So for a 3 credit course we can estimate 9 hours of work per week.
For all your previous labs your instructor had already calculated and scheduled the appropriate
amount of work, now it is your turn!

You are not being graded on how close you estimates match what you actually did, you are graded
on your **attempt** to be as accurate as possible. In the planning document template you will see
a section titled **Time estimation method** where you will detail how you estimated how long
a task would take. It is fully expected that once you start working on a task you discover
lots of dependencies and other issues that you didn't know about. You should report these
discoveries in your weekly reports and update your estimates accordingly!

## Submission checklist

- Planning documents follow the provided template located in the planning folder
  - All required sections are present
  - There is a link to your planning document in root README.md file
- Planning documents all have a detailed user story
  - User story is in role-goal-benefit form
  - User story has sufficient detail to derive 5 tasks
- 5 or more tasks are defined (one task per week is a good goal)
- Planning documents have a detailed write up about the time estimation method used
- The definition of done (DOD) gives clear criteria for determining when the student
  has finished **each** of their tasks and can be demonstrated programmatically.
