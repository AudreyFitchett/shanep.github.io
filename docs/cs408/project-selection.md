# Project Selection

This class allows students to work on an open-ended project that can be driven
in a number of different directions. This week we will form teams and assign
projects.

## Overview

- Assign Teams
- Review the schedule (lecture vs. collaboration time)
  - Tuesdays will be lectures
  - Thursdays will be dedicated to group collaboration time
- Review the group work polices

## Select your project

In class your instructor will present a mix of student submitted projects and
industry inspired instructor projects. Students will rank the projects and the
instructor will assign teams based on student rankings.

## First team meeting

Your only task for this weeks team meeting is to have your first meeting and
start to flesh out the team contract.  All team meetings will be held during
**class** time so 100% of the team should be able to attend. Teams can use Zoom
which can be access with a computer or a phone for maximum flexibility.
