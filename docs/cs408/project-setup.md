# Setup

## Starter repo

Each team is expected to use the starter repo with the same layout. Your team needs to create a
public repo on Github with all team members as contributors and import the started code.

## Repo Bookkeeping

Before we get started you will need to take care of some simple book keeping items for
your repo. You need to update the CONTRIBUTORS file with every team members University
provided email addresses (name@u.boisestate.edu) and update the license
that your team wants to use. You can read about all the different licenses
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository)

Each team member needs to ensure they can push and pull commits to the repo.

## Team contract

You will need to create a team contract to use for the rest of the semester. The intent
of a team contract is to promote academic integrity and accountability among all team members.
The template that you will use is located in the root directory in the class starter repo.

You will be held accountable to the standards that the team comes up with during the semester
so make sure you understand what is expected of you. You should use the team contract template
as a jumping off point. Remember that the team contract is between the team members **not**
between the team and the instructor! The team contract will be used to resolve any conflicts that
arise over the semester.
