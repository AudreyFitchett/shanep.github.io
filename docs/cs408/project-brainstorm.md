#  Project Brainstorm

This class allows students to work on an open-ended project that can be driven in a number of
different directions.  Your task for this week is to come up with one potential project that you
would like to work on and present it to the class. You will then review other student project ideas
and select what you would like to work on.

## Teams

You can choose to work individually or form a team of up to 3 other students.

## Project requirements

Student are allowed to work on any project as long as the following constraints are met:

1. Your project must be full stack and use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) on the backend.
2. Your project can use a front end framework like [vue](https://vuejs.org) or you can write
   everything from scratch
3. If you are working on a team the project must be substantial enough for all team members to make
   meaningful contributions for the duration of the semester.
4. Due to University rules you can't do anything that requires the team to operate in a legal gray
  zone. For example, using [Nintendo
  ROM's](https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/11/20860039/nintendo-copyright-trademark-infringement-rom-lawsuit)
  to build an emulator or building a website that hosts them.

## Project Ideas

Can't think of anything to build? Here are some ideas:

- The [google graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com/) has (at the time of this writing) 205
  killed projects. Keep in mind that google thinks in billions; billions of users,
  billions of dollars, and billions of servers! So a lot of these projects were killed not
  because they were bad ideas or not successful, they were just not in the billions.
- Write a discord bot with a website frontend that does something interesting, like give interesting
  facts about nocturnal giant russian mountain gophers.
- Write a web game. For example you can write a simple asteroids clone or [slither.io](http://slither.io)

## Submitting

- You must submit a 1 page outline detailing what website you want to build to the canvas discussion group
- You must view and respond to 4 other posts
- (optional) Form a team and setup a way to communicate (canvas, discord, slack, etc.)
