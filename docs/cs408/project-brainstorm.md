#  Project Brainstorm

This class allows students to work on an open-ended project that can be driven in a number of
different directions.  Your task for this week is to come up with potential project ideas to present
to the class. You are allowed to form teams if you wish or work individually. The project
presentations will allow you to potentially recruit other students to work with.

## Project requirements

Student are allowed to work on any project as long as the following constraints are met:

1. Your project must be full stack and use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) on the backend.
2. Your project can use a front end framework like [vue](https://vuejs.org) or you can write
   everything from scratch
3. Your project must be substantial enough for all team members to make contributions
   for the duration of the semester.
4. Due to University rules you can't do anything that requires the team to operate in a legal gray
  zone. For example, using [Nintendo
  ROM's](https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/11/20860039/nintendo-copyright-trademark-infringement-rom-lawsuit)
  to build an emulator or building a website that hosts them.

## Project Ideas

Can't think of anything to build? Here are some ideas:

- The [google graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com/) has (at the time of this writing) 205
  killed projects. Keep in mind that google thinks in billions; billions of users,
  billions of dollars, and billions of servers! So a lot of these projects were killed not
  because they were bad ideas or not successful, they were just not in the billions.
- Write a discord bot with a website frontend that does something interesting, like give interesting
  facts about nocturnal giant russian mountain gophers.
- Write a web game. For example you can write a simple asteroids clone or [slither.io](http://slither.io)

## Submitting

At the end of the week all students must submit a slide deck that that you will present to the class
in the following week.
