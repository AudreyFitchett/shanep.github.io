canvas. Do not go to the zyBooks website and create a new account you
**must** sign up through canvas so that your progress is properly
recorded.

## Assessments

Your final grade will be calculated with the following weights in
canvas.

- Quizzes - 30%
- Projects - 40%
- Textbook Activities - 10%
- Class Participation - 5%
- Final Exam - 15%

## Quizzes

There will be several quizzes over the assigned reading and general C++
programming during the semester. The quizzes are open notes and open
book and must be done individually.

## Projects

There are several individual projects this semester. All Projects will
be graded with the [project grading rubric](grading-rubric.md).

- [Project 1](https://github.com/shanep/cs117-p1-starter) - This
    project is the standard "Hello World" project to get you started
    using a programming editor and compiler!
- [Project 2](https://github.com/shanep/cs117-p2-starter) - This
    project will allow the student to practice using variables,
    assignments, simple branching and convert a scientific formula to
    code.
- [Project 3](https://github.com/shanep/cs117-p3-starter) - This
    project will allow the student to understand how to use statements,
    expressions and loops
- [Project 4](https://github.com/shanep/cs117-p4-starter) - This
    project will allow the student to practice using functions.
- [Project 5](https://github.com/shanep/cs117-p5-starter) - This
    project will allow students to practice classes and objects

## Textbook Activities

We will be using an interactive textbook this semester and your progress
through the textbook will be tracked and reported back to canvas

## Class Participation

Students are expected to attend class regularly, participate actively in
the classroom, asking and answering questions on the class discussion
board, taking advantage of office hours, and reaching out to the
instructor as needed.

## Final Exam

The final exam will cover all the assigned reading and labs and will be
a multiple choice exam that is closed book closed notes.
