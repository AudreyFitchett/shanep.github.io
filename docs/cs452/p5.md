# Project 5

![Fun times](./images/p5-meme.jpg)

In this project you will implement a FIFO queue as a monitor that can be
used to solve the bounded buffer problem. Your queue will have a fixed
capacity and will block calling threads when it is full or empty.
Bounded buffers are extremely common in Operating Systems. When you
write code in Java, Python, C#, etc. it may seem like you have infinite
memory. However, infinite memory is just an abstraction that the OS
provides, in reality you are limited by the physical hardware the OS is
running on. This data structure could be used to build higher level
abstractions like a [thread pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool).

## Learning Outcomes

- 1.5 Use simple shell scripts and system tools to analyze process behavior
- 3.3 Identify the sources of deadlocks, race conditions, memory stomps and data loss
- 3.4 Apply concurrent programming techniques such as threads, event loops, and
  inter-process communication
