# Project 6

![This is fine](./images/p6-meme.jpg)

In this project, you are tasked with taking [project 4](p4.md) and
analyzing the effects of multi-treading. You will be using the same
github repository for this project as you did in project 4. If you did
not complete project 4 I can provide a compiled binary that you can use
for this project. You will need to contact me the day this project is
assigned to get the binary, I will not be able to send it to you at
11:59pm the day before the project is due ðŸ¤·.

## Learning Outcomes

This project measures the following course learning outcomes:

- 1.5 Use simple shell scripts and system tools to analyze process behavior
- 3.1 Analyze a complex computing problem and apply principles of
    computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.
    **(ABET Outcome 1)**

## Task 1 - Add bash files

Below is an example bash script and a gnuplot macro file that you will
need to use to generate a nice plot showing the speedup when using
multiple threads. You will need to install
[gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) on your machine to complete this
task. The lab machines in the CS department already have gnuplot
installed. You can install gnuplot on codespaces using
`sudo apt-get install -y gnuplot`.

You will need to modify the script to use in your project! The script
will **NOT** work as is. Part of this project is to learn how to modify
scripts to automate tasks.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#NOTE!!! THIS WILL NOT WORK IF YOU JUST COPY AND PASTE IT INTO YOUR PROJECT
#YOU WILL NEED TO MODIFY IT TO WORK WITH YOUR PROJECT
function usage() {
    echo "$0 usage:" && grep " .)\ #" $0
    exit 0
}
[ $# -eq 0 ] && usage
while getopts "hs:f:" arg; do
    case $arg in
    s) # The size of the array to sort.
        size=${OPTARG}
        ;;
    f) # The plot file name
        name=${OPTARG}
        ;;
    h | *) # Display help.
        usage
        exit 0
        ;;
    esac
done
if [ "$name" == "" ] || [ "$size" == "" ]
then
        usage
        exit 0
fi
if [ -e ./build/myprogram ]; then
    if [ -e "data.dat" ]; then
        rm -f data.dat
    fi
    echo "Running myprogram to generate data"
    echo "#Time Threads" >> data.dat
    for n in {1..32}; do
        echo -ne "running $n thread \r"
        ./build/myprogram "$size" "$n" >> data.dat
    done
    gnuplot -e "filename='$name.png'" graph.plt
    echo "Created plot $name.png from data.dat file"
else
    echo "myprogram is not present in the build directory. Did you compile your code?"
fi
```

```dot
# Gnuplot script file for plotting data in file "data.dat"
set   autoscale                        # scale axes automatically
unset log                              # remove any log-scaling
unset label                            # remove any previous labels
set title "Time to sort vs number of threads"
set xlabel "Time to sort (milliseconds)"
set ylabel "Number of Threads"
set style data linespoints
set term png
set output filename
plot "data.dat" t "time to sort"
```

Assuming that you named your script `createplot.sh` and the gnuplot file
`graph.plt` you can now generate your plot as follows:

```bash
$ ./createplot.sh -s 10000000 -f student_plot
Running myprogram to generate data
Created plot student_plot.png from data.dat file
```

After the script finishes you should see a new file named
`student_plot.png`. We can see in the example below the optimum number
of threads is 5 on my M1 Mac. Your results will vary depending on your
hardware and current system load.

## Task 2 - Complete the Retrospective

Once you have completed all the tasks open the file **Retrospective.md**
and add a new section named **\## Project 6** to the bottom of the
document. In this section you will need to include your graph as an
image so it will display when viewed on github.com. You will then need
to talk about your results. Your discussion should be at least 500
words.

- Were you able to generate something close to what the example showed? Why or why not.
- Did you see a slow down at some point why or why not?
- Did your program run faster and faster when you added more threads? Why or why not?
- What was the optimum number of threads for your machine?
- What was the slowest number of threads for your machine?

If your graph does not look like the example graph you will need to
explain why, maybe go back and look at your original implementation, did
you make a mistake somewhere? If you found a bug in your original
implementation please note that and explain what you fixed ðŸ˜ƒ.

## Task 3 - Add, Commit, Push your code

Once you are finished you need to make sure that you have pushed all
your code to GitHub for grading!
