# Key Process API

-   fork()

-   wait()

-   exec()

-   kill()

-   pipe()

# Fork üç¥

-   creates a child process that is a clone of the parent

-   The child process differs from the parent process only in its
    process id and its parent process id

-   The fork() is called once but it returns twice!

## Exercise

On success, the PID of the child process is returned in the parent, and
0 is returned in the child. On failure, -1 is returned in the parent, no
child process is created, and errno is set to indicate the error.

    /* process A */
     /* ... */
     if ( fork () == 0) {
        if ( fork () == 0) {
            if ( fork () == 0) {
                if ( fork () == 0) {
                    /* do something */
                }
            }
        }
     }

How many new processes are created by the code snippet?

# Waitüöè

Sometimes, as it turns out, it is quite useful for a parent to wait for
a child process to finish what it has been doing. This task is
accomplished with the wait() system call (or its more complete sibling
waitpid()

# Exec

A final and important piece of the process creation API is the exec()
system call. This system call is useful when you want to run a program
that is different from the calling program

# Signals

Linux/Unix signals are a type of event. Signals are asynchronous in
nature and are used to inform processes of certain events happening (man
7 signal).

## Examples

-   SIGINT

-   SIGCONT

-   SIGKILL
