# Project 1

![P1 Meme](images/p1-meme.jpeg)

## Overview

This project is intended to serve as an introduction to the project template,
build tools, and process to complete projects during this semester. This project
demonstrates the only **officially** supported tools and programming languages.

We are going to review the following topics:

1. How to setup your project with the provided starter code
2. How to use the build system
3. How to write unit tests
4. Demonstrate address sanitizer output
5. How to use the debugger
6. Submitting the project over email

## Learning Outcomes

- 5.1 Compile your code with a build system
- 5.2 Use a professional unit test framework  (win32, posix)
- 5.3 Use a professional version control system (git)
- 5.4 Explore compiling and running code on at least 2 different systems (Codespaces and the CS Lab)
- 5.5 Explore how to setup a continuous integration and testing project

## Task 2 - Prepare your repository

The starter repository is a bare bones template that you will need to update with the starter code below.

### lab.h

<<< @/code/452/p1/lab.h

### lab.c

<<< @/code/452/p1/lab.c

### main.c

<<< @/code/452/p1/main.c

### test-lab.c

<<< @/code/452/p1/test-lab.c

## Task 3 - Compile

You can compile the project by typing `make` in the terminal.  Once you have successfully compiled
the project you can run the executable like this:

```bash
$ ./myprogram
What is your name?shane
Hello shane! This is the starter template version: 0.1
```
::: info

Not all projects will have an executable to run. Some projects will only consist of a unit tests.

:::

## Task 4 - Test

The starter template is setup with a testing harness that will make it easy to write and run
tests. You can compile all the tests and then run them by typing `make check`. The project template
is setup to compile your code with [Address
Sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html). This approach will allow us to write
high quality code and catch bugs early so when we are working on larger projects we can focus on the
project requirements instead of the low level details of memory errors. Address sanitizer can detect
the following types of bugs:

- Out-of-bounds accesses to heap, stack and globals
- Use-after-free
- Use-after-return (clang flag
    -fsanitize-address-use-after-return=(never|runtime|always) default:
    runtime)
- Enable runtime with:
    ASAN\_OPTIONS=detect\_stack\_use\_after\_return=1
- Use-after-scope (clang flag -fsanitize-address-use-after-scope)
- Double-free, invalid free
- Memory leaks (experimental and currently only on linux)

You should see a bunch of tests fail.  You need to fix all the issues in the
project before proceeding to the next task. There should be no build warnings,
no disabled tests, and everything should pass.

::: info

This is just a warm-up project. The functions that are failing can be fixed in any number of ways. I
am not looking for any specific fix, I am just looking for you to make the tests pass instead.

:::

## Task 5 - Run the debugger

This starter template should work out of the box for both unit tests and the executable. Open the
debugger view in VSCode and set a breakpoint in the `main` function and a breakpoint in one of the unit test
functions.  Run the debugger and verify that the debugger stops at the breakpoints. You will need to
run the debugger separately for the unit tests and the executable.

::: warning

While this task is not graded it is important that you are able to use the
debugger, so don't skip this task. Make sure you can use the debugger **now**
instead of at 11:45pm the night the project is due and there is no one around to
help you.

### Debugging Pointers

In the C programming language we can allocate a chunk of memory on the
heap and treat that chunk of memory as an array. If you are working on
debugging a problem and want to inspect the contents of the array using
the GUI debugger interface in VSCode you may have to tell the debugger
(with a cast) that a pointer is actually pointing to a dynamically
allocated array not a single variable. This example walks through how to
display a pointer as an array that is embedded within a struct.

More reading about C and GDB.

- [Reading C Declarations](http://unixwiz.net/techtips/reading-cdecl.html)
- [GDB Artificial Arrays](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Arrays.html)
- [GDB to LLDB usage](http://lldb.llvm.org/use/map.html)
- [VSCode Data inspection](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_data-inspection)

Consider the struct declaration `buddy_pool` shown below. The `avail`
member is a pointer that we must dynamically allocate and want to
display in the debugger as an array. We can allocate the a `buddy_pool`
struct (in the stack or data segment) and then dynamically allocate the
`avail` array using `malloc`.

```c
struct avail
{
    int tag;
    int kval;
    struct avail *next;
    struct avail *prev;
}
struct buddy_pool
{
    size_t kval_m;
    uintptr_t base;
    struct avail *avail; /*pointer to the start of the avail array*/
};
struct buddy_pool pool;
pool.kval = 9;
pool.base = 0;
pool.avail = malloc(sizeof(struct avail) * 9);
```

If we run the debugger we will see the variable `pool` with the element
`avail` is displayed as a single variable not an array of 9 structs as
we expected.

![Pointer not showing the full array](images/pointer_as_array_bad.png)

The element `avail` is just a pointer to the memory address of element
and the debugger canâ€™t determine the size of the array and thus will
display it as a single struct instead of an array as expected.

Fortunately, all is not lost! Most debuggers allow you to set a watch on
a memory location and you can force the debugger to cast the memory to a
certain type. Both gdb and lldb have specific commands to display a
memory block as an array. However, using casting works regardless of
what debugger you are using.

If we add a new
[watch](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_data-inspection)
on a variable and then force the debugger to display the memory block as
an array instead of a single variable we can easily inspect the data and
track down any issues you are experiencing.

`(struct avail(*) [9])pool->avail`

![Watch var showing the full array](images/setting_watch_vscode.gif)

For a plain old dynamic array you can add a watch expression that is set
to to the desired type.

`*(int(*)[10])A`
