## Overview

This assignment is intended to serve as a warm up assignment. It may have been a
long time since you have written any code in C/C++, so we will get warmed up by
writing a circular doubly linked list. This will allow you get up to speed using
C and refresh your knowledge of pointers, struct's, and manual memory
management.  We will write our code in C but use a C++ compiler so we can take
advantage of the gtest framework and more strict compile time checks to help
make your code more robust. You can only use C++ in the unit testing harness
everything else must be in C.

## Learning Outcomes

This project measures the following course learning outcomes:

- 4.1 Produce code that is free of all memory leaks
- 4.2 Produce code without any out of bounds read/write errors
- 5.1 Use a cross platform build system (win, linux)
- 5.2 Use a professional unit test framework (win, linux)
- 5.3 Use a professional version control system (git)

## Circular Linked List with Sentinel Node

It is sometimes helpful to draw out what your data structure will look
like in memory before you start coding anything up. Having a visual
model to reference can aid in both development and testing. The diagram
below shows a list with 3 elements and a sentinel node. You can see that
the next pointer in node **n3** points back to the sentinel node and the
prev pointer of **n1** points back to the sentinel node. Each node has a
data pointer that will hold a reference to the data that is being stored
in the list. Using a sentinel node allows us to write slightly simpler
algorithms when manipulating the list.

## Thinking in C

Java is an Object Oriented (OO) programming language while C is an
imperative language. The purpose of both is to break large computing
tasks into smaller ones. While pre-ANSI C (known as K&R C) had very
strange function declarations, functions in ANSI C (C89 and greater)
have a similar look and feel to Java.

One of the biggest differences between functions in C and methods in
Java is Java groups your functions and data together into a class. So in
java if you want to create a new linked list and then add something to
it you would create a new list and then call the **add** method on that
list:

```c
Mylist list = new Mylist();
list.add(new Object());
```

In C the code above would be written as follows:

```c
struct object *obj = create_object();
struct mylist *list = create_list();
list_add(list, obj);
```

So as you can see with the examples above any code that is written in
Java using objects can be translated to C!

## Task 0 - Setup

You will need to create a new project repository for each project. You **must**
use the [repository
template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
feature to create your project repository. **DO NOT FORK** the project
repository or you will not be able to complete future projects.

1. Use the [project starter](https://github.com/shanep/cs452-project-starter)
   template to create a new project repository in your github account. Name the
   repository `cs452-p1`.
2. Clone your **new** repository to your local machine.
3. Copy the contents of [lab.h](https://gist.github.com/shanep/135122dc80e9a17c59d8157eee81849d) into `src/lab.h`
4. Copy the contents of [test-lab.cpp](https://gist.github.com/shanep/cc8c7ae3e8ac28ac3af80bbd7c1f185b) into `tests/test-lab.cpp`
5. Add and commit all files to your local repository and then push them to Github.

## Task 1 - Implement the header file

Implement all the functions defined in `lab.h` in `lab.cpp`.

## Task 2 - Write Unit tests

Follow the instructions in the project README to run the code coverage tool.
Add enough tests beyond what the professor has given you to get as close to 100%
coverage as possible.

## Task 3 - Submit the project

In the README.md follow the instructions in the Project Submission Checklist
to submit your project for grading.
