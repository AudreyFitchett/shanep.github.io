# Project 6

![Fun times](./images/p6-meme.jpg)

## Overview

In this project you will implement a FIFO queue as a monitor that can be
used to solve the bounded buffer problem. Your queue will have a fixed
capacity and will block calling threads when it is full or empty.
Bounded buffers are extremely common in Operating Systems. When you
write code in Java, Python, C#, etc. it may seem like you have infinite
memory. However, infinite memory is just an abstraction that the OS
provides, in reality you are limited by the physical hardware the OS is
running on. This data structure could be used to build higher level
abstractions like a [thread pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool).

## Learning Outcomes

- 1.5 Use simple shell scripts and system tools to analyze process behavior
- 3.3 Identify the sources of deadlocks, race conditions, memory stomps and data loss
- 3.4 Apply concurrent programming techniques such as threads, event loops, and
  inter-process communication

## Task 0 - Setup

You will need to create a new project repository for each project. You **must**
use the [repository
template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
feature to create your project repository. **DO NOT FORK** the project
repository or you will not be able to complete future projects.

1. Use the [project starter](https://github.com/shanep/cs452-project-starter)
   template to create a new project repository in your github account. Name the
   repository `cs452-p5`.
2. Clone your **new** repository to your local machine.
3. Copy the contents of each file in the
   [gist](https://gist.github.com/shanep/b35dfe9787bb23030753304a3288ba19) into
   the respective file in your local repository.
4. Add and commit all files to your local repository and then push them to Github.

## Task 1 - Implement the header file

Implement all the functions defined in `lab.h` in `lab.cpp`.

- [pthread tutorial](https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/pthreads/)
- [Intro to Threads](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/threads-intro.pdf)
- [Condition Variables](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/threads-cv.pdf)
- [Threads API](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/threads-api.pdf)

## Task 2 - Write Unit tests

Follow the instructions in the project README to run the code coverage tool.
Add enough tests beyond what the professor has given you to get as close to 100%
coverage as possible.

## Task 3 - Submit the project

In the README.md follow the instructions in the Project Submission Checklist
to submit your project for grading.
