# Project 3

![P3 Meme](./images/p3-meme.jpeg)

## Overview

You job is to implement a memory manager using the buddy algorithm as
described by Dr. Knuth in The Art of Computer programming Volume 1 -
Fundamental Algorithms. You will use the mmap() system call to get a
large block of memory to manage. From there on, manage the chunk of
memory returned by mmap using your own memory management functions.

## Learning Outcomes

- 2.1 Demonstrate how low level memory is managed in user space
- 2.2 Explore the system call interface

## Task 0 - Setup

You will need to create a new project repository for each project. You **must**
use the [repository
template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
feature to create your project repository. **DO NOT FORK** the project
repository or you will not be able to complete future projects.

1. Use the [project starter](https://github.com/shanep/cs452-project-starter)
   template to create a new project repository in your github account. Name the
   repository `cs452-p3`.
2. Clone your **new** repository to your local machine.
3. Copy the contents of [lab.h](https://gist.github.com/shanep/0cb45892b293c17a17c6eae14983c57c) into `src/lab.h`
4. Copy the contents of [test-lab.cpp](https://gist.github.com/shanep/cbd9cbebe9e5adb2538070257d10300a) into `tests/test-lab.cpp`
5. Add and commit all files to your local repository and then push them to Github.

## Task 1 - Implement Buddy

Implement the [Buddy Algorithm](/articles/Buddy-System.pdf).

::: warning

You are NOT allowed to use **any functions** from the math library! You are
required to use bit shifting and masking for your calculations. So this means no
`pow()` or `log2()` functions should be found in your code.

:::

## Task 2 - Write Unit tests

Follow the instructions in the project README to run the code coverage tool.
Add enough tests beyond what the professor has given you to get as close to 100%
coverage as possible.

## Task 3 - Submit the project

In the README.md follow the instructions in the Project Submission Checklist
to submit your project for grading.

## Additional Resources

From the example in Knuth’s book we can calculate the buddy of a block
of size 16. With the table above we know that a block of size 16 is K=4
so we will have 4 zeros at the right. Using the [XOR
operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or) we can calculate
the buddy as follows:

       101110010110000
     ^ 000000000010000
    ------------------
       101110010100000

### Knuth notation to C syntax quick reference

    struct buddy_pool *pool;
    struct avail *L;

| Knuth notation | C syntax               |
|----------------|------------------------|
| AVAILF[k]      | pool-&gt;avail[k].next |
| AVAILB[k]      | pool-&gt;avail[k].prev |
| LOC(AVAIL[k])  | &amp;pool-&gt;avail[k] |
| LINKF(L)       | L-&gt;next             |
| LINKB(L)       | L-&gt;prev             |
| TAG(L)         | L-&gt;tag              |
| KVAL(L)        | L-&gt;kval             |
| buddyk(L)      | buddy_calc(pool, L);   |

### Power of 2 quick reference

As specified in the algorithm in order for everything to work you must
work in powers of two! This includes the address that you get back from
mmap. You will need to scale the address appropriately or you will
calculate invalid buddy values. You can use the table below for a quick
reference for up to K=40.

| Power (k value) | Bytes             | KiB/MiB/GiB/TiB |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|

### Hints


- There should be no hard coded constants in your code. You will need
    to use the macros defined in the [C99
    standard](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/integer) to get the
    correct width. For example to calculate a K value 64bit system you
    would write `UINT64_C(1) << kval` NOT `1 << kval`
- Remember to take into account the size of your header when
    calculating your K value. If a user asked for 32 bytes you will need
    to use K=6 not K=5 to account for the header size.
- If the memory cannot be allocated, then your buddy\_calloc or
    buddy\_malloc functions should set errno to ENOMEM (which is defined
    in errno.h header file) and return NULL.
- You can’t use malloc/free/realloc/calloc from the C standard library.
- You will need to make extensive use of pointer arithmetic! When you
    are dealing with raw (untyped) memory make sure and cast the pointer
    to the correct type so it is moved the correct amount.
- Be mindful of the differences between `sizeof(struct foo)` and
    `sizeof(struct foo*)`. The first instance give you the size of the
    struct while the second gives you the size of a pointer. If the size
    of the struct just **happens** to be the same as a pointer your code
    will appear to work until you either add a new member to `foo` OR
    you move to a system where the sizes of pointers are different. For
    example moving from a 64bit system to a 32 bit system or vice versa!
