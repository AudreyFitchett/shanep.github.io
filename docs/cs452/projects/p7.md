# Project 7

![This is fine](./images/p7-meme.jpg)

In this project, you are tasked with implementing a simple kernel module that
will allow you to add a new system call in the kernel.

## Learning Objectives

- 2.2 Explore the system call interface
- 2.3 Show an understanding of the difference between user and kernel space

## Task 0 - Setup

You will need to create a new project repository for each project. You **must**
use the [repository
template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
feature to create your project repository. **DO NOT FORK** the project
repository or you will not be able to complete future projects.

1. Use the [project starter](https://github.com/shanep/cs452-project-starter)
   template to create a new project repository in your github account. Name the
   repository `cs452-p5`.
2. Clone your **new** repository to your local machine.
3. Copy the contents of each file in the
   [gist](https://gist.github.com/shanep/b6084d2be0adb6c0b8c4301843eb7b8c) into
   the respective file in your local repository.
4. Add and commit all files to your local repository and then push them to Github.
