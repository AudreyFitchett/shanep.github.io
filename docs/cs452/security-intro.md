# OS

-   Pretty much everything runs on top of an operating system

-   The OS is the ultimate target

-   Subvert the OS and nothing else matters!

# What Are We Protecting?

-   examine or alter any process’s memory

-   read, write, delete or corrupt any file

-   change the scheduling or even halt execution of any process

-   send any message to anywhere

-   enable or disable any peripheral device give any process access to
    any other process’s resources

-   arbitrarily take away any resource a process controls

-   respond to any system call with a maximally harmful lie

# TMP

-   Trusted Platform Module - provided assurance that you were booting
    the version of the operating system you intended to, protecting you
    from attacks that tried to boot compromised versions of the system.

-   Not perfect just raises the degree of difficultly when cracking a
    system.

# Goals of the OS

-   Confidentiality -If some piece of information is supposed to be
    hidden from others, don’t allow them to find it out.

-   Integrity - If some piece of information or component of a system is
    supposed to be in a particular state, don’t allow an adversary to
    change it

-   Availability - If some information or service is supposed to be
    available for your own or others' use, make sure an attacker cannot
    prevent its use.
