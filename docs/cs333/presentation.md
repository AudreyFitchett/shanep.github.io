# Presentation

In this assignment, you will need to make a presentation of your work.
The length of the presentation will be based on how many students are
enrolled in the class and will be announced well before the due date. A
good talk will include a clear statement of the problem you are
studying, a discussion of how you went about investigating the problem
and the results.

Teams will be randomly ordered on presentation day(s) so if you are late
to class you could miss your time slot. Students can not request to go
first or last. While minor technical difficulties are expected and will
not impact your grade, it is expected that students make their
presentation as robust as possible, a minor glitch should not tank your
entire presentation. Here are some tips to ensure you have a smooth
experience:

## Requirements

1. Make sure your presentation is available in multiple formats. For example you
   should upload your presentation to your google drive account and copy it to a
   flash drive.

2. Make sure you have all the correct dongles to connect to the
   projector. If you have a Mac with only thunderbolt connectors you
   need to make sure you bring what is necessary to hook into the
   projectors. If you show up to class on presentation day and you
   can’t connect to the projectors because you don’t have the correct
   dongles your grade may be impacted!

3. Make sure your laptop is charged! Make sure you have your charger
   with you. If you are running windows make sure you have updates
   paused and reboot your computer to make sure everything is working.

4. Test your setup in the classroom before the presentation day to make
   sure everything works. Your instructor can arrange time for you to
   test your setup in the classroom, it is strongly encouraged that
   teams take advantage of this!

5. The only thing that should stop you from presenting is a power
   outage, so plan accordingly!

6. If the presentations are done remotely using zoom make sure that you
   have a reliable internet connection and a quiet place to present.

7. All students must have their cameras on if the presentations are
   over zoom. If students don’t have a camera they must notify the
   instructor **before** presentations are due!

**NOTE:** When presentations are done over zoom students will not be
penalized for tech issues that are outside of their control such as
bandwidth problems, dropped connections, etc. This rubric was derived
from an example at [Purdue
University](https://www.purdue.edu/science/Current_Students/curriculum_and_degree_requirements/oral_rubrics_gray.pdf).
