- Final Exam - 20%

## Quizzes

There will be several quizzes over the assigned reading during the
semester. The quizzes are open notes and open book and must be done
individually.

## Labs

There are 11 individual labs this semester. Each lab below has been
carefully crafted to satisfy one or more Learning Outcomes. The labs for

and Linux virtual machines that you will need to use and configure.

## Textbook Activities

We will be using an interactive textbook this semester and your progress
through the textbook will be tracked and reported back to canvas

## Final Exam

The final exam will cover all the assigned reading and labs and will be
a multiple choice exam that is closed book closed notes. The questions
for the final exam are drawn from the same question pools as the quizzes
