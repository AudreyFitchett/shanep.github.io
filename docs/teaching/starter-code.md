# Starter Code

Projects will generally be available the week before they are assigned.
If you are seeing this it means the project is not quite ready to work
on yet, or I forgot to post the link. If it is time to start working on
the project please email me and let me know I have forgotten to post the
github classroom link 😁

In the meantime check out these sweet under [construction
gif’s](http://textfiles.com/underconstruction/) from the 1990’s!
