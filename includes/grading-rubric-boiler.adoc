== Testing

For the testing criteria your code will be ran against your instructors private
test suite. The test suite will consist of both automated tests such as unit
testing and system testing as well as manual testing in cases that unit testing
is not feasible.

=== Student Authored Tests

Students are expected to write tests to ensure correct code. The question that
is always asked is how many tests? At a minimum you should write at least one
test for every **public** function or method. This includes any untested functions that
were provided for you. You should make sure that you
test bad inputs as well as good inputs. Your program should not crash if a user
inputs bad data!

If the project is UI based and must include manual testing you must detail the
manual tests that you used to ensure your code was correct.

== Code Quality

Code Quality will be judged on the criteria defined in each section below.

=== Correctness

Projects have been carefully crafted to ensure certain learning objectives are
satisfied. Thus, you are required to solve the problem as described in the
specification. For example, if the specification asks you to write CSS in an
external file and you write inline CSS your solution would not be correct even
though your code may pass all the instructor provided tests. Simply looking at
the output is not sufficient to determine correctness! The bottom line is code
that runs and produces correct output does not mean you implemented the
specification correctly.

You are not allowed to change the instructor provided tests in any way. You must
pass the tests as they are written.

Correctness consists of (but is not limited to):

* Validating user input
** User input should not crash your program
* Validating function arguments
** Malformed input to your functions should not cause a crash
** What happens if you pass NULL or undefined to function arguments
** Passing values that are out of range such as negative numbers
** Checking the return values of your functions to ensure that the function is returning expected values
* Defining https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_invariant[loop invariants] where appropriate.
* Implementing header files as defined
* Using the API calls that are explicitly called out in the specification.

=== Global Variables

IMPORTANT: All **public** global variables are 100% banned. Private, protected,
or stack local variables variables are OK. If you truly think that the only way
to solve the problem is to use a global variable then you must **clearly**
document why you are forced to use a global variable.

There are instances where it is necessary to use a public global variable
because you are dealing with a legacy API, writing a device driver, or you are
working with a poorly implemented SDK. These cases will be clearly detailed in
the project specification and you will be allowed to use global variables in
those cases.

Global variables make writing concurrent, async, multi-threaded code very
difficult. So even if you are not writing concurrent code (or don't even know
what that means at this point) it is good to start training yourself to use
good habits so the code you write can easily be used in a concurrent environment
instead of having to refactor your code in the future.

=== Formatting

Except for languages like python, code formatting for the most part does not
impact functionality. Formatting can be very subjective so no particular style
is enforced, it is only important that you are consistent within your own code.

There should be no reason for poorly formatted code when your editor will
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29973357/how-do-you-format-code-in-visual-studio-code-vscode[do
it for you]! What makes code more or less readable is often controversial and
opinionated. In this class we will not address the philosophical aspect of
putting braces on the end of the line or on a new line, or the classic debate of
tabs vs spaces, we will primarily focus on being consistent.

English scholars have long known that
https://www.vappingo.com/word-blog/the-importance-of-punctuation/[punctuation
matters]. To quote from
https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/paragraphs_and_paragraphing/index.html[purdue's
writing lab] ‚ÄúGood paragraphing also greatly assists your readers in following a
piece of writing‚Äù. The readability of source code is also greatly improved by
good formatting. Just because the compiler or interpreter ignores whitespace
doesn't mean you should as well.

=== Spelling and Grammar

I generally do not care about spelling or grammar mistakes, it is not an area I
excel in :) The only exception to this rule is if your writing is so bad I
literally can't make heads or tails of what you are trying to say. At a minimum
you should spell check your documents and attempt to write as clearly as
possible.
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker[Spell
checkers] are even available that work with camelCase code!

=== Code Ownership

The starter code that is given to you may not be up to the guidelines specified
in the grading rubric. It is your responsibility to bring all code up to the
standards specified regardless of the original author. If your instructor does
not intend for you to fix any pre-existing issues it will be clearly marked by a
comment in the source. Don't assume that all code pushed out by your instructors
is perfect, in fact some code may be wrong on purpose. Learning how to read and
fix other engineers code is a very important skill to learn. You take
responsibility for 100% of the code that you submit regardless of who originally
wrote it.

WARNING: Some of the starter code will have **intentional defects**! That your
instructor intends for you to fix! Do NOT assume that all code given to you is
perfect.

== Documentation

For the purpose of grading there are two important things to note.

. Each function (method) or class must have a header documentation string specifying
what the function does, what each function parameter does, and what the return
value is.
. Documentation inside a function (method) is only necessary when you have
exceptionally complex code or you need to detail **why** you are doing something
non-obvious or against what has been taught in class or the textbook.

Your documentation string will be language dependent. For example in Java you
will use
https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html[JavaDoc]
while Javascript will use https://jsdoc.app/[JSDoc] and C/C++ will use
https://www.doxygen.nl/[Doxygen]. If you have any questions as to what
documentation tool you should be using you need to reach out to your instructor
or TA for guidance.

Example for Java:

[,java]
----
/**
 * Validates a chess move.
 *
 * @param fromFile file from which a piece is being moved
 * @param fromRank rank from which a piece is being moved
 * @param toFile   file to which a piece is being moved
 * @param toRank   rank to which a piece is being moved
 * @return         true if the move is valid, otherwise false
 * @since          1.0
 */
boolean isValidMove(int fromFile, int fromRank, int toFile, int toRank) {
    // ...body
}
----

Example for JavaScript:

[,javascript]
----
/**
 * Updates the current position of the mouse given an x,y coordinate
 *
 * @param {double} x The x coordinate of the mouse
 * @param {double} y The y coordinate of the mouse
 */
function updateMouseLocation(x, y) {
    // ...body
}
----

Example for C\C++:

NOTE: For C and C++ you only have to document functions in the header files.

[,c]
----
/**
* @brief Create a new list with callbacks that know how to deal with the data that
* list is storing. The caller must pass the list to list_destroy when finished to
* free any memory that was allocated.
*
* @param destroy_data Function that will free the memory for user supplied data
* @param compare_to Function that will compare two user data elements
* @return struct list* pointer to the newly allocated list.
*/
LAB_EXPORT list_t *list_init(void (*destroy_data)(void *),
                                int (*compare_to)(const void *, const void *));
----

== Retrospective

Each programming project contains a file name Retrospective.md. While I really
don't like having hard word counts I have found that if I don't specify a
minimum **some** students will take advantage of that and submit nothing of
substance. The Retrospective is important for me as it gives some insight into
your learning process and helps me understand where you may be struggling. Thus,
it is expected that the **Experience** section is at least 200 words long.

I would like you to address the following questions as well as anything else you
would like to share.

* How did you test your project?
* Were there any things that you struggled with?
* Were there any parts of this lab that were unclear or poorly specified?
* Were you able to get the entire project done?
* Detail one new thing you learned.
* Anything else you would like to share is awesome and encourage üòÉ.

You must include any graphs, screenshots or other artifacts as requested. You
can reference the
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#images[markdown]
help docs for how to include images.

For the **Known issues or Bugs** section you need to detail any issues or bugs
that you have in your code. For example maybe your code crashes randomly and you
couldn't figure out why. If your code doesn't have any issues you can simply
write NONE in this section.

For the **Sources used section** you must detail any sources you used outside of
the
textbook or course website. If you write NONE in this section it is assumed that
you didn't use google at all. Be safe CITE!
