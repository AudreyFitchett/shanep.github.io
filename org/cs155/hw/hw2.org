In this homework you will learn how to use git to create a patch that can be emailed to another
developer. This method of development is how git was originally designed to work and is still widely
used by massive projects like the [[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html][Linux Kernel]]. It may take a few attempts to get everything correct
but once you are able to wrap your head around the process you will have unlocked a powerful
software development skill!

GitHub pull requests are *not* accepted for this assignment and will result in a score of 0. You
must follow the instructions to create a patch to send over email.
