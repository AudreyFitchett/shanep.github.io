There are several individual projects this semester. All Projects will
be graded with the [[file:grading-rubric.org][project grading rubric]].

- [[https://github.com/shanep/cs117-p1-starter][Project 1]] - This project is the standard "Hello World" project to get you started using a
  programming editor and compiler!
- [[https://github.com/shanep/cs117-p2-starter][Project 2]] - This project will allow the student to practice using variables, assignments, simple
  branching and convert a scientific formula to code.
- [[https://github.com/shanep/cs117-p3-starter][Project 3]] - This project will allow the student to understand how to use statements, expressions
  and loops
- [[https://github.com/shanep/cs117-p4-starter][Project 4]] - This project will allow the student to practice using functions.
- [[https://github.com/shanep/cs117-p5-starter][Project 5]] - This project will allow students to practice classes and objects
