* Overview
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: vscode-tips-and-tricks
:END:
This document will walk you through doing development using VSCode and
introduce you to some cool tips and tricks. You can install VSCode on
your personal machine, or you can use VSCode in the cloud with
[[https://github.com/features/codespaces][GitHub Codespaces]].

* Install VSCode
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: install-vscode
:END:
You can install VSCode and all the required tools on your personal
(local) machine. The advantages of using a local install is it is 100%
free and you don't need an internet connection to do your work. The
disadvantage is it can sometimes be difficult and time consuming to
install and configure all the tools correctly especially if you are
using the Windows operating system.

1. [[https://git-scm.com/downloads][Install Git]]
2. [[https://code.visualstudio.com/learntocode/][Install Visual Studio Code (Java)]]
3. Read through the [[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface][User interface tutorial]]
4. [[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics][Read Terminal Basics]]
5. Complete all the steps in the first time configuration section of
   this document.

* First time configuration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: first-time-configuration
:END:
Before we start using VSCode we need to set a few basic configurations.
Each section is clearly labeled with what operating system it applies
to. You need to follow these steps on both local and remote setups.

** Configure defaults
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: configure-defaults
:END:
This section must be completed on ALL operating systems.

The last step before beginning to write code is to configure the user
tags that will be stored as metadata on each commit for your development
environment. To do this, open VSCode then click View in the top menu and
select Terminal. Enter the following commands in the terminal, using
your name and email address

#+begin_src sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
#+end_src

When you are first learning to use git using a rebase workflow can help
to reduce the number of conflicts that you have to deal with. Thus, we
will set it as the default method when pulling down code.

#+begin_src sh
git config --global pull.rebase true
git config --global fetch.prune true
git config --global diff.colorMoved zebra
git config --global core.ignorecase false
#+end_src

** Configure the default terminal (Windows Only)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: configure-the-default-terminal-windows-only
:END:
This section only applies to Windows users who are developing locally.
If "Git Bash" is not listed as an option you need to
[[https://git-scm.com/downloads][install Git]] as detailed in the first
section of this document.

VSCode defaults to powershell on Windows. While powershell is a great
terminal all the scripts in my classes require Git Bash. So it is best
to set the default terminal to Git Bash so everything works correctly

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Press CTRL + SHIFT + P to open the Command Palette
3. Search for "Terminal: Select Default Profile"
4. Select "Git Bash"

* Developing Remotely
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: developing-remotely
:END:

This section is optional and is provided for students who wish to
develop remotely. You are not required to develop remotely, all the
homework assignments can be done on the CS lab machines in the CCP
building.

Your professor or teaching assistant can not provide tech support for
personal machines.

This section will walk you through using VSCode to develop remotely.
This is incredibly convenient as it allows you to connect directly to a
server to run and test your code. For advanced users you can read
through the [[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh][official
documentation]] for more details on how everything works.

** Setup a Remote Connection
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: setup-a-remote-connection
:END:
- First you need to install the
  [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack][Remote development extension pack]]

  #+caption: Click in the lower left hand corner and then select "Connect to   Host..."
  [[file:images/vscode_connect.png]]

  #+caption: Select "+ Add New SSH Host..."
  [[file:images/vscode_connect_add_new_host.png]]

  Type in your username and host name. Your username is the same as your BSU email. For example, if
  your email is jimbob@u.boisestate.edu then your username is *jimbob*. The host name will be
  onyx.boisestate.edu.  So the connection string will be *jimbob@onyx.boisestate.edu*.

  #+caption: Type in your username and hostname
  [[file:images/vscode_connect_usr_and_host.png]]

  #+caption: Select the default ssh configuration profile
  [[file:images/vscode_connect_ssh_config.png]]

  #+caption: Select Connect on the pop up in the lower right of your screen.
  [[file:images/vscode_connect_popup.png]]

  #+caption: Enter in your password
  [[file:images/vscode_connect_password.png]]

  #+caption: The entire process
  [[file:images/vscode_remote_devel.gif]]

  Depending on your operating system you may see slightly different popups
  that what is shown in the screenshots above. That is to be expected and
  should not impact your ability to connect to onyx.boisestate.edu.

**** Verify your connection
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: verify-your-connection
:END:
Once you are connected you can verify your status as shown below:

1. You should see SSH: onyx.boisestate.edu
2. When you run the command /hostname/ in the integrated terminal you
   should see onyx.boisestate.edu
3. When you run the command /whoami/ in the integrated terminal you
   should see your Boise State username.

** Installing remote extensions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: installing-remote-extensions
:END:
When you are working remote VSCode does not automatically install any of your extensions. To get all
your remote extensions installed open the [[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery][Extension manager]] and then select the local extensions
that you wish to install on the remote machine.

* Connect to an Existing Remote
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: connect-to-an-existing-remote
:END:
Assuming you have followed the steps above to setup a new remote connection you can now reconnect
anytime. Select /Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...​/ from the Command Palette and connect to
/username@servername.com/

#+begin_quote
You can bring up the Command Palette by hitting the F1 key
#+end_quote

  #+caption: Select connect to started developing
  [[file:images/vscode_connect_existing.png]]

The first time you connect it may take some time for VSCode to install all the tools so be patient
and don't close or stop the process or it could cause your install to fail!
