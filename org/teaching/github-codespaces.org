* Overview
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: github-codespaces
:END:
This section is not required for all classes. Please check your class
syllabus to see if developing in the cloud is required. If using
codespaces is not required in your class you can skip this section.

[[https://github.com/features/codespaces][GitHub Codespaces]] is a complete VSCode development environment in the cloud. It is the quickest and
easiest way to write code on any machine that has an internet connection and web browser. GitHub
Codespaces provides a free tier (60 hours) that should be enough cover all the usage for a student
working on homework. However, you still may need to pay a small fee depending on how much you use
the service over the course of a semester.

* Starting a Codespace
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: starting-a-codespace
:END:
Every repository will need its own Codespace. Creating a Codespace is
fairly straight forward after you have cloned your repository simply
click the *code button* and then click the *Create Codespaces* as shown
below. This will launch a Codespace that you can use to work on your
project.

* Configuring Codespace
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: configuring-codespace
:END:
When you are working remote VSCode does not automatically install any of your extensions. To get all
your remote extensions installed open the [[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery][Extension manager]] and then select the local extensions
that you wish to install on the remote machine. The first extension that you should install is Live
Preview as shown below.

* Remote Website Development
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: remote-website-development
:END:
As long as you are using the [[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal][integrated terminal]] in VSCode you can launch a website that you built
on the server and VSCode will automatically forward the ports for you so you can view it
locally. For simple websites that don't need to run a web server you can use the Live preview
feature. After you have installed the VScode Live preview extension you can start the built in web
server just as you would when developing locally.

Sometimes you will see an error when trying to view your website (shown below). This is because
there is sometimes a delay on how fast Codespaces sets up port forwarding. If you click the "Open in
Browser" popup it should open up a new tab showing you your website.

* Running a Web Server
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: running-a-web-server
:END:
For more complicated setups like when you want to run a PHP server
server from Nodejs, you can start the server just like you normally
would and then view you website from the ports tab show below.

* Accessing the menu in Codespaces
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: accessing-the-menu-in-codespaces
:END:
For the most part using Codespaces is identical to developing remotely.
One of the biggest differences is accessing the Menu toolbar. The
screenshot below shows you how to access the toolbar in Codespaces.

* Codespaces Set default timeout
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: codespaces-set-default-timeout
:END:
The default idle timeout for codespaces is 30 minutes. You can quickly
burn through all your free hours if you keep this default. I recommend
that you set the default timeout to 10 minutes to preserve your free
tier time.
