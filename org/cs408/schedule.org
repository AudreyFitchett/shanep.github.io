* Week 6 Fullstack
  - Quiz

* Week 7 Accessibility
  - Quiz

* Week 8 - 9 Project Brainstorm

This class allows students to work on an open-ended project that can be
driven in a number of different directions. Your task for this week is
to come up with one potential project that you would like to work on and
present it to the class. You will then review other student project
ideas and select what you would like to work on.

** Teams

You can choose to work individually or form a team of up to 3 other
students.

** Project requirements

Student are allowed to work on any project as long as the following
constraints are met:

1. Your project must be full stack and use
   [[https://nodejs.org/en][Node.js]] on the backend.
2. Your project can use a front end framework like
   [[https://vuejs.org][vue]] or you can write everything from scratch
3. If you are working on a team the project must be substantial enough
   for all team members to make meaningful contributions for the
   duration of the semester.
4. Due to University rules you can't do anything that requires the team
   to operate in a legal gray zone. For example, using
   [[https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/11/20860039/nintendo-copyright-trademark-infringement-rom-lawsuit][Nintendo ROM's]] to build an emulator or building a website that hosts them.

** Project Ideas

Can't think of anything to build? Here are some ideas:

- The [[https://killedbygoogle.com/][google graveyard]] has (at the time
  of this writing) 205 killed projects. Keep in mind that google thinks
  in billions; billions of users, billions of dollars, and billions of
  servers! So a lot of these projects were killed not because they were
  bad ideas or not successful, they were just not in the billions.
- Write a discord bot with a website frontend that does something
  interesting, like give interesting facts about nocturnal giant russian
  mountain gophers.
- Write a web game. For example you can write a simple asteroids clone
  or [[http://slither.io][slither.io]]

** Submitting

- You must submit a 1 page outline detailing what website you want to
  build to the canvas discussion group
- You must view and respond to 4 other posts
- (optional) Form a team and setup a way to communicate (canvas,
  discord, slack, etc.)

* Week 10 Project setup

** Starter repo
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: starter-repo
:END:
Each team is expected to use the starter repo with the same layout. Your
team needs to create a public repo on Github with all team members as
contributors.

** Repo Bookkeeping
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: repo-bookkeeping
:END:
Before we get started you will need to take care of some simple book
keeping items for your repo. You need to update the CONTRIBUTORS file
with every team members University provided email addresses
(name@u.boisestate.edu) and update the license that your team wants to
use. You can read about all the different licenses
[[https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository][here]]

Each team member needs to ensure they can push and pull commits to the
repo.

** Team contract
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: team-contract
:END:
You will need to create a team contract to use for the rest of the
semester. The intent of a team contract is to promote academic integrity
and accountability among all team members. The template that you will
use is located in the root directory in the class starter repo.

You will be held accountable to the standards that the team comes up
with during the semester so make sure you understand what is expected of
you. You should use the team contract template as a jumping off point.
Remember that the team contract is between the team members *not*
between the team and the instructor! The team contract will be used to
resolve any conflicts that arise over the semester.

** Continuous Integration

Keeping your code base healthy is an important part of the software
engineering process. For this class we will leverage
[[https://github.com/features/actions][Github Actions]] to test your
code.

For this lab you will *setup* some basic GitHub actions to build and
test your code. you must also document *how* you setup continuous
integration with your particular language and frameworks. If you are
working on a project where CI is not possible (Robotics, Unsupported OS,
etc.) then you must contact your instructor for alternatives.
Additionally, if you use other CI services such as
[[https://travis-ci.org/][travis-ci]] you must get instructor permission
first!

One cool feature of GitHub Actions the ability to have a
[[https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow#adding-a-workflow-status-badge-to-your-repository][status
badge]] that you can add to your README so your users can quickly know
what the status of your project is by just looking on GitHub. You need
to add a status badge to the README.md in your repository showing at a
minimum your build status. If your code does not have a build
(JavaScript, python, etc.) then you must show your testing status
instead. You can set up as many different badges as you wish you are not
just limited to one.

** Submission checklist

- Download the starter code and setupAccept the Github Classrooms
  Assignment
- Update the CONTRIBUTORS file with each students email.
- Choose and update your LICENSE file.
- team-contract.md is completed to the teams satisfaction
- Setup a github action to build and test your project on every commit
- Add a Status Badge to the root README.md

* Week 11 - 14 Feature Development

You will be given in class time to meet with your team and instructor to
collaborate and work on your project features. In industry a typical
software company will have what is called a daily standup. We can't do a
daily standup in this class so we will be doing a weekly standup meeting
using zoom.

** Progress Reports

* Week 15 - 16 Final Presentation

Students will be randomly ordered on presentation day(s) so if you are
late to class you could miss your time slot. Students can not request to
go first or last. While minor technical difficulties are expected and
will not impact your grade, it is expected that students make their
presentation as robust as possible, a minor glitch should not tank your
entire presentation. Here are some tips to ensure you have a smooth
experience:

** Requirements

1. Make sure your presentation is available in multiple formats. For
   example you should upload your presentation to your google drive
   account and copy it to a flash drive.
2. Make sure you have all the correct dongles to connect to the
   projector. If you have a Macbook with only thunderbolt connectors you
   need to make sure you bring what is necessary to hook into the
   projectors. If you show up to class on presentation day and you can't
   connect to the projectors because you don't have the correct dongles
   your grade may be impacted!
3. Make sure your laptop is charged! Make sure you have your charger
   with you. If you are running windows make sure you have updates
   paused and reboot your computer to make sure everything is working.
4. Test your setup in the classroom before the presentation day to make
   sure everything works. Your instructor can arrange time for you to
   test your setup in the classroom, it is strongly encouraged that
   teams take advantage of this!
5. The only thing that should stop you from presenting is a power
   outage, so plan accordingly!
6. If the presentations are done remotely using zoom make sure that you
   have a reliable internet connection and a quite place to present.
7. All students must have their cameras on if the presentations are over
   zoom. If students don't have a camera they must notify the instructor
   *before* presentations are due!
