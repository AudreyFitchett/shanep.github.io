* Final Presentation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: final-presentation
:END:
Students will be randomly ordered on presentation day(s) so if you are
late to class you could miss your time slot. Students can not request to
go first or last. While minor technical difficulties are expected and
will not impact your grade, it is expected that students make their
presentation as robust as possible, a minor glitch should not tank your
entire presentation. Here are some tips to ensure you have a smooth
experience:

** Requirements
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: requirements
:END:
1. Make sure your presentation is available in multiple formats. For
   example you should upload your presentation to your google drive
   account and copy it to a flash drive.
2. Make sure you have all the correct dongles to connect to the
   projector. If you have a Macbook with only thunderbolt connectors you
   need to make sure you bring what is necessary to hook into the
   projectors. If you show up to class on presentation day and you can't
   connect to the projectors because you don't have the correct dongles
   your grade may be impacted!
3. Make sure your laptop is charged! Make sure you have your charger
   with you. If you are running windows make sure you have updates
   paused and reboot your computer to make sure everything is working.
4. Test your setup in the classroom before the presentation day to make
   sure everything works. Your instructor can arrange time for you to
   test your setup in the classroom, it is strongly encouraged that
   teams take advantage of this!
5. The only thing that should stop you from presenting is a power
   outage, so plan accordingly!
6. If the presentations are done remotely using zoom make sure that you
   have a reliable internet connection and a quite place to present.
7. All students must have their cameras on if the presentations are over
   zoom. If students don't have a camera they must notify the instructor
   *before* presentations are due!

*NOTE:* When presentations are done over zoom students will not be
penalized for tech issues that are outside of their control such as
bandwidth problems, dropped connections, etc. This rubric was derived
