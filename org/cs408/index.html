I, like most people, am far from perfect. Some semesters I have an overwhelming number of students
to track and things unintentionally fall through the cracks. If I made a mistake with your grade
don&rsquo;t panic!  Take a deep breath and just send me an email with the details and I will take a
look. Remember everything will be OK, I am here to help you as best I can.

<h2 id="extra-credit-opportunities">Extra Credit Opportunities</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-extra-credit-opportunities">
<p>
Standing extra credit is always offered to allow students to bump their grade up if they are on a
grading boundary so please take advantage of any extra credit offered. Any extra credit given over
the semester can not exceed 2.5% of the total points offered. For example, the maximum number of
extra credit points that you can earn if the total points offered is 1000 would be 25.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Typos and Bugs</b></b> If you find any typos or bugs in the course materials, you can make the
corrections on <a href="https://github.com/shanep/shanep.github.io">GitHub</a>, and then issue a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request">pull request</a>. If I merge your changes back into my
repository then I will give you 5 bonus points. I have strategically placed several spelling and
grammar errors for you to find so there are plenty of opportunities to get the maximum number of
points offered. So make sure and read everything with an eagle eye so you can rack up those points!
</p>

<p>
Creating a pull request is important and is the core learning objective in the extra credit
process. No points will be awarded for any other method of submission. Some pages may include other
pages so you may have to look for an <code>#:include</code> directive which will have the path to the file that
needs to be updated :)
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Use of AI technologies</b></b> If you are able to solve 100% of any assignment with AI, I will give you
extra credit if you submit your chat logs as proof that it was in fact 100% AI generated. See the
AI section for more details.

<div id="outline-container-homework-policy" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="homework-policy">Homework Policy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-homework-policy">
<p>
Unless explicitly instructed otherwise students are expected to work on their own. All group work
will be <b>clearly</b> marked so there should be no confusion. The <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/coen-cs/currentstudents/success-tutoring">Kount Computer Learning Center</a>
(CCP 241) is accessible 24/7 by proxy card to all students enrolled in CS courses. Machines in the
Kount Computer Tutoring Center have all the software you will need this semester.
</p>

<p>
All of your programming assignments will be submitted using GitHub or with emailed
patches. Submissions via any other method such engraving your source code onto a stone tablet, or
wizard scroll will not be accepted under any circumstances. You are encouraged to make consistent
commits to your Git repository over the course of working on your project.
</p>

<p>
Former students will post their projects for employers to see and you can find them with a simple
Google search. ChatGPT can give at least a partial solution if not full solution to some of the
projects in this class. Stackoverflow.com has solutions to most common problems that students will
encounter. It is not feasible for me to create brand new projects every semester nor is it feasible
to police the internet for solutions to my projects. Therefore in this class I will trust that you
are here to learn and will not seek out solutions to the projects. I expect all students to adhere
to the Universities Academic Integrity policy. If you get stuck on a project please attend office
hours for help instead of searching for a solution online.

<div id="outline-container-ai-policy" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="ai-policy">AI Policy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-ai-policy">
<p>
Developer tools such as an IDE or AI should be used to <b>enhance</b> your skills not replace them! AI in
the hands of an experienced developer makes that developer even more productive! AI in the hands of
a student robs them of the opportunity to learn!
</p>

<p>
I feel that we are experiencing a new paradigm shift that last happened in 1998 when Google Search
was released. Google Search fundamentally changed how students approached finding information. Then
in 2004 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Scholar">Google Scholar</a> was released and you no longer had to spend hours in the library combing
through indexes or paper journals, you could just type your query into a little box and get millions
of results instantly. It&rsquo;s hard to overstate how dramatic the shift was to people who didn&rsquo;t live
through it. Google was nothing short of mind-blowing compared to what existed before.
</p>

<p>
Banning tools that are broadly available only results in creating a low trust environment in the
classroom. Thus, in my class you are free to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)">AI or Machine Learning technologies</a> to complete
your assigned work. However, I strongly encourage anyone who is learning to code to <b>NOT</b> use AI or
even an IDE. When you are learning something new it is OK to struggle and get things wrong that is
part of the learning process. Think back to your 2nd or 3rd grade class when you were learning to
spell, did your teacher let you use spell check on your spelling tests? What would be the point of
taking a spelling test if you could? As you have moved up in education, using a spell checker is a
great way to <b>enhance</b> your underlying skills. However, even the best spell checkers in the world
can&rsquo;t help someone who doesn&rsquo;t understand the basics of grammar or syntax (look at all the spelling
and grammar errors that I make).
</p>

<p>
If you do choose to use AI you <b>must cite</b> your usage and you will now be graded on the code that it
writes. If you truly believe that ChatGPT can <b>always</b> give the best solution to any problem then
you may want to switch majors because why would a company hire you if they can just use ChatGPT to
write all their code?
</p>

<p>
Take for example the two possible solutions for a <code>size()</code> method in a typical linked list. Can you
spot the problem? While both solutions do work and produce correct results, the AI generated
solution is O(N) while the <b>better</b> solution is O(1). If you don&rsquo;t know why one is better than the
other then I would strongly suggest you not use AI tools until you get more experience.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-java">//ChatGPT generated - O(N) performance
public int size() {
    int size = 0;
    Node current = head;
    while (current != null) {
        size++;
        current = current.next;
    }
    return size;
}
</pre>
</div>

<div class="org-src-container">

<div class="danger" id="org7a19969">
<p>
It is still plagiarism to claim work that was generated by <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> or other AI tools as your own and
you will be written up for Academic dishonesty if you do not cite your usage of any AI tools.
</p>

</div>

<p>
When you are learning new material early assignments are intentionally easier to help you build up
your skills. Leaning too heavily on AI early on will hurt you when you get to more complex
assignments. You may not even feel the pain until you get to your 300 or 400 level courses. Trust me
when I say AI can not solve most of the programming assignments in your 400 level courses. I test my
assignments against modern AI tools and sometimes see hilariously wrong results, so if you are not
able to recognize correct vs incorrect results you should not be using AI in the first place. So the
bottom line is if you know enough about the given subject to be able to recognize correct vs
incorrect results then you should be free to use said tools to enhance your productivity and
education.

I follow the official <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/registrar/registration/attendance-policy/">attendance policy</a> as defined by the university. Please see the Late Work

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-late-work-policy">
<p>
All homework assignments can be submitted up to <b>2 days late with no penalty</b>. After the 2 day grade
period no further submissions will be accepted unless prior arrangements have been made. No work or
extra credit will be accepted after the <b>last day of course instruction</b>, the semester has to end at
some point so plan accordingly. Work submitted 1 second late is treated the same as work submitted 1
day late. You can find the last day of course instruction at the <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/registrar/boise-state-academic-calendars/">registrar</a>.
</p>

<p>
For classes taught in the first 5wk or 7wk session of the semester, the last day of course

All class interaction assignments must be completed within the time frame specified on canvas or

interactive are only valuable when everyone is participating at the same time. It is not fair for a
student to expect their fellow classmates to respond or watch your submission that is late when
everyone else submitted on time. The secret code for the syllabus quiz is &ldquo;green&rdquo;.

I prefer students to contact me through the <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-send-a-message-to-a-user-in-a-course-in-the-Inbox-as-a/ta-p/502">canvas inbox</a> due to the fact that I receive a large
volume of regular email every day. I try to respond to all messages in a timely manner however,
sometimes I miss messages, so if you don&rsquo;t receive a response from me after 48hrs please check to
make sure you are sending the email from canvas and send a follow-up message. You can also send a
direct email to me if I am not getting your messages for some reason.
</p>

<p>
BroncoMail is the official communication channel through which all university business is
conducted. It is expected that you access and read university communications two or three times per
week. For more information see the University Policy on Student Email Communications (Policy
2280). Your instructor will not respond to any emails sent from personal accounts such as Gmail or
Yahoo.
</p>

<p>
I will make every effort to return emails within 24hrs Monday thru Friday between the hours of
9:00am and 5:00pm (MST). Emails sent on Saturday, Sunday, or outside of the defined hours will be
returned within 24hrs on the following business day. Emails should be reserved for questions that
are not appropriate for a public forum such as grades or other personal issues.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-time-commitment">
<p>
According to Boise State University <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/policy/academic-affairs-faculty-administration/policy-title-credit-hours/">policy 4080</a>, a 1 credit course spread over 15 weeks should
require roughly 3 hours of work per week divided over both in-class interactions and
homework. Classes that are held in compressed time frames such as summer or winter breaks still need
to complete the same number of credit hours in order for the class to count toward your
degree. Thus, if you are taking this class in a compressed semester please consult the table below
to make sure you have time to complete all the assigned course work. For example, as noted in the
table below, taking two 3 credit courses in a 7 week semester is equivalent to working a full time
job.
</p>

<p>
For a compressed course it is <b>critical</b> that you don&rsquo;t fall behind!  Compressed courses move fast
and missing 1 week of class is very hard if not impossible to recover from.
